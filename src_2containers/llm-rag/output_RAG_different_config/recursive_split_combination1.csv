Diet quality tends to decrease as children get older, leading to concerns about underconsumption of important nutrients.  School meal programs, such as the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, can play a significant role in providing nutritious meals to children, especially those experiencing food insecurity.  These programs are available to children enrolled in various settings, including childcare centers, daycare homes, and afterschool programs.  While these programs help, active community support is also needed to ensure children meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrient-dense foods and beverages.  The provided text also mentions calorie needs generally increase during childhood to support growth and development, with girls typically needing fewer calories than boys.  A U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern framework is available to help children and adolescents follow healthy eating habits, and the Summer Food Service Program helps bridge the gap when school is not in session.

Chapter 2 focuses on this age group and provides key recommendations along with guidance on implementing them.  It emphasizes healthy dietary patterns during each life stage, including infancy and toddlerhood, recognizing the varying nutrient needs and unique considerations for each.  The chapter also offers suggestions for supporting healthy dietary patterns within this population.  Additionally, the guidelines address introducing complementary foods around 6 months and encouraging varied consumption of nutrient-dense foods and beverages.  The provided text mentions calorie needs for toddlers aged 12-23 months can be found in Appendix 2, and Figure 2-1 likely contains further information, but the specifics are not included in this excerpt.  The text also mentions resources to support healthy growth and development, including government programs, but doesn't detail them here.

The USDA Dietary Patterns provide a framework that can be adapted to personal preferences, budget, and culture.  These patterns illustrate appropriate amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components.  The guidelines emphasize the importance of healthy dietary patterns at every life stage, noting that while nutrient needs vary, recommended foods and beverages remain consistent.  The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern is the primary example and offers a framework for healthy eating for all Americans.  For adults, these patterns consider factors like current intake patterns, prevalence of overweight and obesity, and diet-related chronic diseases.  This includes focusing on dietary changes to increase certain nutrients and support healthy weight management.  More information on preventing weight gain can be found at cdc.gov/healthyweight/prevention/index.html, and information on weight loss is available at cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing_weight/index.html.

Pellett and Young (1994) discuss plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition.  Promoting non-animal protein sources in Sub-Saharan Africa has also been studied (Bako & Olwari, 2011).  Brazier (2013) discusses why and how to consume plant-based protein, while Mangels (2013) focuses on protein in vegan diets.  ""Understanding Nutrition"" (Whitney & Rolfes, 2002, 2016) likely contains relevant information, but the provided text does not offer specifics from this source regarding plant proteins.  The benefits and functions of protein in general are mentioned, including their role in metabolic and immune processes, energy production when fat and carbohydrate levels are low, and the impact of excess or deficient protein intake on overall health.  However, the provided text lacks details specific to the role and significance of *plant* proteins as highlighted in ""Understanding Nutrition.""

While calorie needs generally decrease, nutrient needs remain similar or even increase compared to younger adults. This is due to factors like age-related bone and muscle loss.  Absorption of nutrients can also be affected by chronic diseases, medication use, and changes in body composition.  The chapter emphasizes the importance of a healthy dietary pattern tailored to the unique needs of older adults, offering specific recommendations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging.  It also mentions that it's never too late to improve dietary habits, regardless of race, ethnicity, or current health status.

They should focus on nutrient-dense foods to address the higher requirements for certain nutrients during these life stages.  

Pregnant and lactating women face similar nutritional challenges as the general U.S. population, including inadequate intakes of calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and dietary fiber.  They also tend to consume too many added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.  Data shows that these women are generally below or in the lower range of recommendations for food groups and subgroups.  Specific calorie adjustments for pregnancy and lactation are available in Table 5-2 of the Dietary Guidelines, but this table was not provided in the text chunks.  The guidelines also emphasize the importance of food safety considerations during pregnancy.  Low-income women can benefit from resources that supplement food budgets and support healthy eating.  It's crucial for women to work with healthcare providers to achieve their health goals during these times.

Several nutrients are underconsumed, including calcium, vitamin D, and dietary fiber.  If following a healthy dietary pattern, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber intake can meet recommendations.  Later chapters highlight additional underconsumed nutrients during specific life stages.  Meeting Dietary Guidelines recommendations within calorie needs helps prevent excess weight gain and supports good health at all ages.  The guidelines focus on supporting healthy dietary patterns, considering individual needs, preferences, cultural traditions, and budgets.  A key concern for adults is addressing overweight, obesity, and diet-related chronic diseases, focusing on dietary changes to increase the intake of underconsumed foods like vegetables.

Federal data indicates that despite dietary guidelines, many people fall short of recommended healthy eating habits.  A diet high in fat, especially trans and saturated fats and cholesterol, increases the risk of heart disease.  Keeping fat intake below 35% of daily calories is recommended.  A balanced diet combined with regular physical activity contributes to overall health and well-being, both now and in the future.  While diet-related chronic diseases remain a major public health concern, increased awareness and education on healthy food choices are steps towards mitigating these risks.

Careful review of dietary data, including supplements, can reveal risk factors for chronic diseases, allowing for preventative measures (Johansson, 2006).  While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the implication is that accurate recording of supplement intake helps create a complete picture of an individual's nutritional status, which is crucial for both disease prevention and management.  This is particularly relevant as micronutrient deficiencies, which can sometimes be addressed through supplementation, can lead to significant health problems (Wilson, 2007).  Furthermore, environmental factors like poverty and illiteracy can be associated with nutritional deficiencies (""Clinical assessment,"" 1973), highlighting the importance of a thorough assessment that includes supplementation details.

It is used because it generally correlates with body fat and is a valuable tool for assessing obesity prevalence at the population level due to its ease of measurement and global use, enabling comparisons across different groups.  A BMI over 30 is considered obese and a risk factor for diseases like diabetes.  However, BMI has limitations. It doesn't directly measure body fat but rather uses the relationship between weight and height.  It can be a poor measure for older adults because while BMI may remain stable, body composition changes with age (loss of lean muscle and increased body fat).  Body composition measurements may be a more accurate indicator of disease risk as they directly measure body fat.  Waist circumference is also a factor, with larger waists (94 cm or more in men and 80 cm or more in women) linked to increased risk of obesity-related health problems.  While both BMI and body composition aim to assess body fat and predict disease risk, body composition provides a more precise measurement of actual body fat.  The classification of BMI can vary for children, adults, and older adults.
