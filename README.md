# AC215 - Milestone2 - SmartEats

**Project:**

In this project, we aim to develop SmartEats, an AI-powered application that analyzes food images, predicts disease risks based on dietary habits, and offers personalized nutrition advice. 
an application named SmartEats, which will take the food image as input from users and generate nutrition components with advise and potential disease risks. It will first require users to upload food pictures, and then it will use image recognition to estimate nutritional components like protein and fats and also display the amounts of each
component ideally. Based on the results, SmartEats will calculate calories, assess potential health risks, and provide tailored dietary suggestions, such as healthy recipes.

### Milestone2 ###

In this milestone, we have the components for data management, including versioning, as well as the computer vision and language models.

**Data**
We gathered a dataset of 100,000 cheese images representing approximately 1,500 different varieties. The dataset, approximately 100GB in size, was collected from the following sources: (1), (2), (3). We have stored it in a private Google Cloud Bucket.
Additionally, we compiled 250 bibliographical sources on cheese, including books and reports, from sources such as (4) and (5).

**Data Pipeline Containers**
1. One container processes the 100GB dataset by resizing the images and storing them back to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

	**Input:** Source and destination GCS locations, resizing parameters, and required secrets (provided via Docker).

	**Output:** Resized images stored in the specified GCS location.

2. Another container prepares data for the RAG model, including tasks such as chunking, embedding, and populating the vector database.

## Data Pipeline Overview

1. **`src/datapipeline/preprocess_cv.py`**
   This script handles preprocessing on our 100GB dataset. It reduces the image sizes to 128x128 (a parameter that can be changed later) to enable faster iteration during processing. The preprocessed dataset is now reduced to 10GB and stored on GCS.

2. **`src/datapipeline/preprocess_rag.py`**
   This script prepares the necessary data for setting up our vector database. It performs chunking, embedding, and loads the data into a vector database (ChromaDB).

3. **`src/datapipeline/Pipfile`**
   We used the following packages to help with preprocessing:
   - `special cheese package`

4. **`src/preprocessing/Dockerfile(s)`**
   Our Dockerfiles follow standard conventions, with the exception of some specific modifications described in the Dockerfile/described below.


## Running Dockerfile
```
cd src                 # move into the directory with docker-shell.sh
sh docer-shell.sh      # the pipeline consisting of multiple containers will run sequentially 
```

**Models container**
- This container has scripts for model training, rag pipeline and inference
- Instructions for running the model container - `Instructions here`

**Notebooks/Reports**
This folder contains code that is not part of container - for e.g: Application mockup, EDA, any 🔍 🕵️‍♀️ 🕵️‍♂️ crucial insights, reports or visualizations.
