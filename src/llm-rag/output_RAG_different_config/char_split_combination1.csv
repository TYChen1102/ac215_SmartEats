School meal programs, such as the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, play a crucial role by potentially providing nearly two-thirds of a child's daily calories.  These programs are especially important for children experiencing food insecurity.  The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) also supports healthy eating by reimbursing meals and snacks aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for eligible children in childcare and afterschool programs.  The Summer Food Service Program helps children access nutritious meals when school is not in session.

Chapter 2 focuses on this age group, recognizing their unique nutritional needs.  The guidelines emphasize establishing healthy dietary patterns at every life stage, including infancy and toddlerhood, to support healthy growth and development.  Key recommendations include avoiding foods and beverages with added sugars, limiting those higher in sodium, and, as infants wean, ensuring a transition to a healthy dietary pattern.  As toddlers integrate more with family meals, the guidelines address new considerations for maintaining a lifelong healthy dietary pattern.  More detailed information for this age group can be found in Chapter 2 of the guidelines.

These guidelines emphasize a holistic approach, focusing on dietary patterns across the lifespan rather than individual nutrients or foods.  The guidelines are designed to be personalized based on individual wants and needs, food preferences, cultural traditions and customs, and budgetary considerations.  Additionally, the guidelines address the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diet-related chronic diseases, focusing on increasing intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and vitamin D while decreasing intakes of added sugars and saturated fat.  While the provided text mentions the *existence* of recommended Healthy Dietary Patterns for this age group, it does *not* describe the specific food groups, amounts, or nutrient profiles within these patterns.  For more details on the specific recommendations, you would need to consult the referenced appendices and the online appendix of the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.

While some sources suggest concerns about high-protein diets promoted without enough scientific data, plant proteins offer a valuable alternative to animal proteins.  One source notes that only 1 out of every 10 calories needs to come from protein.  It is a common misconception that plant proteins are not sufficient sources of protein.

Combining different plant proteins, a practice called complementation, can improve the overall quality of protein intake.  This is important because some plant proteins are limited in certain essential amino acids, such as legumes being limited in methionine, while cereal grains are limited in lysine.  Combining these foods creates complementary proteins, ensuring those on plant-based diets receive complete proteins.  This information is primarily drawn from Young & Pellet (1994) and Mangels (2013).

However, nutrient needs remain similar or even increase compared to younger adults.  Therefore, nutrient density is crucial for this age group.  The chapter also highlights potential underconsumption of nutrients like protein and vitamin B12 and addresses the increased risk of malnutrition due to changing dietary needs and other factors like chronic diseases, medication use, and changes in body composition.  The chapter emphasizes the importance of a healthy dietary pattern for older adults regardless of race, ethnicity, or current health status, stating it's never too late to make positive changes.

They should focus on nutrient-dense foods and beverages, limiting those high in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.

Current intakes show that while diet quality is higher among these women compared to non-pregnant or non-lactating peers, it's still not optimal, with intakes below or in the lower range of recommendations for many food groups.  Specific nutritional challenges aren't detailed in this text, but it mentions that women are not meeting recommendations for food group and nutrient intake.  The text also emphasizes the importance of supporting these women by considering barriers and developing programs and resources to help them make healthy choices.  It also states that women do not need to restrict their food choices during pregnancy or lactation unless medically indicated.

Adolescent females show low intakes of iron, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12.  Adolescents (ages 14-18) have the greatest risk of dietary inadequacy compared to other age groups. Low intakes of nutrient-dense foods from the grains, dairy, fruits, and vegetable food groups are common among adolescents.  The text suggests increasing the intake of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and dairy.  Fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful to address nutrient shortfalls.  If a healthy dietary pattern is followed, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber intake can meet recommendations.  The text does not provide specific details on the public health implications of these underconsumptions.

Consuming nutrient-dense foods and meeting food group and nutrient needs helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases.  Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and physical activity is also crucial, especially in adulthood where diet-related chronic diseases are prevalent.  While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans offer recommendations, data shows Americans fall short of meeting them.  A dietary assessment, including anthropometrics (weight-to-height ratio and BMI), a physical exam, and biochemical exam, can help uncover potential risks and aid in disease prevention.  Focusing on a healthy diet is important across all life stages and for all populations, particularly those disproportionately affected by diet-related disparities.

A dietary assessment is one component of a full nutritional assessment, which also includes anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, and clinical evaluations.  Nutritional assessments can help identify potential health risks, such as those related to chronic diseases.  For example, if a dietary assessment reveals potential deficiencies or excesses, steps can be taken to prevent or manage related health problems.

It's a standard method used to measure the prevalence of obesity at the population level due to its ease of measurement and consistency across large populations.  BMI is also used globally, allowing comparisons between different groups.  For most individuals, BMI correlates with body fat levels.

However, BMI has limitations.  Factors like fitness and ethnic origin can affect the relationship between BMI and body fat.  For example, muscular individuals may be classified as overweight or obese based on BMI despite having healthy body fat percentages.  Similarly, BMI may not be accurate for older adults experiencing sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass) and increased body fat percentage, even if their BMI remains stable.  Additionally, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat but uses the relationship between weight and height to estimate it. Body composition, which measures actual body fat, may be a more accurate indicator of disease risk.  Waist circumference is another measurement that can be used in conjunction with BMI to assess weight status and risk, with larger waist circumferences (94 cm or more in men and 80 cm or more in women) indicating higher risk.  While both BMI and body composition provide valuable health information, BMI may be used as an estimate of body composition.  Both are used to evaluate body fat and predict risk for certain diseases.
