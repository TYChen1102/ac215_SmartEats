1.1 Defining Nutrition
[
]
1.1.1 You Are What You Eat
[
]
Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion (2014).
Our bodies contain similar nutrients to the food we eat. Therefore, depending on what kind of food we are consuming and the contents of that food, we are affecting our nutrient levels and over all, our health. On average, the human body is 6% minerals, carbohydrates, and other nutrients, 16% fat, 16% protein, and 62% water. Of course these percentages vary for every individual person depending on diet and lifestyle. Our bodies contain similar nutrients to the food we eat. Therefore, depending on what kind of food we are consuming and the contents of that food, we are affecting our nutrient levels and over all, our health. As mentioned above, it is important to eat a wide variety of foods from the five food groups to ensure that you are consuming all the different nutrients that your body needs. Eating one type of food may supply you with excess of a particular nutrient, but your body will be lacking other vital nutrients only obtainable from different foods. The saying, "You are what You Eat," isn't literally true because if you eat a hamburger, that doesn't make you a cow, however, your nutrient levels will equilibrate with that of the hamburger, or cow, that you are eating. Therefore, always make sure that you are putting healthy foods in your body because it doesn't just come in one end and go out the other. The foods you eat alter the nutrients in your body, making it very important to eat foods that will have a positive and beneficial impact on your body and your health. Almost everything is ok, in proportion. If you eat some ice cream or some candy every once in a while, it will not have a significantly detrimental impact on your health. However, if you eat large quantities of high-sugar foods, such as candy, you can continuously tax your system and eventually cause problems that can effect your health forever, such as Type 2 Diabetes.
It is important to make a habit of healthy eating. The more often you eat healthy, the easier it will be and the more you will start to enjoy healthy foods over un-healthy foods. It can be difficult sometimes to choose an apple over a candy bar and you don't always have to, but in the long run, your body will thank you for eating healthy. We often don't think about the nutritional content of our food, but do some research and find out what you're really putting in your body when you eat certain foods. Awareness of the contents of our consumption is the first step in moving towards a healthier diet and therefore a healthier body.
1.1.2 Malnutrition
[
]
Definition
[
]
According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, malnutrition is defined as "lack of proper nutrition, caused by not having enough to eat, not eating enough of the right things, or being unable to use the food that one does eat". At first thought, it is easy to think of malnutrition as only not having enough food however as the definition so evidently points out, it also incorporates not eating enough of the right things for your body or if your body is unable to use the food you are ingesting for what it needs.
It is extremely important to eat a well balanced diet in order to stay in healthy standing as well as giving your body the nutrients it needs to sustain your active life.
Causes, Incidence, and Risk Factors
[
]
There are a number of causes of malnutrition. It may result from an inadequate or unbalanced diet, problems with digestion or absorption, certain medical conditions.  Malnutrition can occur if you do not eat enough food. Starvation is a form of malnutrition. You may develop malnutrition if you lack of a single vitamin in the diet.  In some cases, malnutrition is very mild and causes no symptoms. However, sometimes it can be so severe that the damage done to the body is permanent, even though you survive.  Malnutrition continues to be a significant problem all over the world, especially among children. Poverty, natural disasters, political problems, and war all contribute to conditions—even epidemics—of malnutrition and starvation. A study conducted by Action Against Hunger-USA (ACF-USA) among children under five in the Nuer community of Old Fangak, central Upper Nile, found that most of the malnourished children had been sick over an extended period, suffering from diarrhea, respiratory infections and fever, or a combination of several illnesses. Disease and inadequate food intake seemed to have particularly affected children under five years old, the report stated.
1.1.3 Macronutrient basics
[
]
As the name macro suggests carbohydrate, protein, lipids, fats and water make up the bulk of the diet and signify the items the body requires to be consumed in large quantities.  In addition, carbohydrate, protein and lipids are the body's main source of energy, with carbohydrate and protein providing 4 kcals/g (16.8 kJ/g) and lipids providing 9 kcals/g (37.8 kJ/g).
Carbohydrates
[
]
Carbohydrates are the body cell's main source of energy, providing approximately 35-70% of the dietary intake, which is acquired through the consumption of sugars and starches.
This increases the body’s blood glucose levels.
The energy supplied by carbohydrate is of particular importance to the brain as the body's only carbohydrate-dependent organ.
This category also includes dietary fiber, which are either soluble or insoluble and offer several health benefits. Carbohydrates are divided into two categories: simple, which include items made up of 1 or 2 sugars, which increase the blood glucose level quickly and complex, which includes from 3 to >10 sugars and increase the bloods glucose levels more slowly.  Typical sources are wheat, rice, potatoes, fruit, sugar beet and whole grains. Carbohydrates are an essential part of the diet and should not be restricted, choosing the complex variety is the healthiest option.
Carbohydrate Associated Disease
[
]
Excessive consumption of refined sugar and simple carbohydrates can contribute to obesity and the onset of type 2 diabetes.
[

]
Diabetes is dysfunction of the body’s ability to metabolize glucose due to insufficient levels or ineffective use of insulin.
Simple carbohydrates in food and drinks are also associated with increased risk of dental caries, (Mobley, Marshall, Milgrom, & Coldwell, 2010).
Good start, what might excess sugar intake mean for other macronutrient and micro-nutrient intake?
Protein
[
]
Protein should make up 10-23% of the bodies intake for energy.
In addition to providing energy protein also assists with the regeneration and growth of cells, acquired by the consumption of 9 essential amino acids and 11 non-essential amino acids, which are synthesized in the body.
Typical sources of essential amino acids are meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and soya, which constitute complete proteins or combinations such as rice and lentils and peanut butter sandwiches.
Protein Associated Diseases
[
]
Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a group of protein deficiency disorders,
including marasmus, kwashiorkor and a combination condition marasmus-kwashiorkor.  Marasmus is a wasting disease characterized by emaciation and is an adaptive response to starvation.  Kwashiorkor in contrast, is characterized by a swollen belly, but is also a wasting disease and a mal-adaptive response to starvation.
Lipids
[
]
The lipid macronutrient group is made up of fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols. Lipids should make up 20-45% of the bodies energy intake.
In addition to providing energy lipids also assist the body with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
Fatty Acids
Fatty acids are divided into three categories saturated, which is not essential to the body and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.  There are 2 essential fatty acids that the body can’t produce linoleic acid (omega 6) and linolenic acid (omega 3).
Excellent sources of essential fatty acids are fish and flax seed and canola oil.
Triglycerides
Triglycerides are a type of blood lipids. They are organic compounds composed of one glycerol and three fatty acid molecules. When the fatty acids combine with the alcohol glycerol, it is referred to as an ester. The body produces triglycerides in the liver, however they are also consumed as part of the diet. Triglycerides are present in both plant and animal food sources (AHA Staff, 2013). Plant sources of triglycerides include vegetable oils such as sunflower oil and peanut oil. The animal sources of triglycerides are present as solid forms in foods like meat products such as beef, or dairy products such as whole milk (Staff, 2015). Within the body, triglycerides function as an energy source like other types of lipids. However, triglycerides differ in that they primarily function as stored energy (Staff, 2013). When calories of any form, whether it be protein, carbohydrates, or fats, are consumed in excess, the body stores the extra energy in the form of triglycerides (Staff, 2015). Located in fat cells, triglycerides are stored until the body generates hormones to release the triglycerides for energy. Like cholesterol, triglycerides are hydrophobic and cannot be dissolved in the blood (Staff, 2015). For this reason, specialized transport proteins known as lipoproteins are responsible for circulating triglycerides throughout around the body through the bloodstream. Normal blood triglyceride levels are considered anything below 150 milligrams per deciliter of blood. High levels of triglycerides in the body are associated with a hardening of the arteries known as atherosclerosis, as well as other cardiac diseases (Staff, 2015)
Phospholipids
A phospholipid is a class of lipids that makes up a small minority of lipids found in the diet. They are commonly found fat-containing foods and oils. A phospholipid is made up of a glycerol with 3 attachment sites. Two of those attachment sites contains fatty acids and the third site contains a phosphate group. The two attached fatty acids are hydrophobic, thus making them insoluble in water, but soluble in fat. The attached phosphate group is hydrophilic allowing them to dissolve in water, but not in fat. Phospholipids are able to be synthesized in the body through chemical changes to triglycerides. As a result, phospholipids are not a dietary essential for the body. However, they are found naturally in foods. These hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads play a crucial role in the functions of phospholipids: As a component of cell membranes and as emulsifiers. A cell membrane is composed of phospholipids packed tightly together in a structure called a bilayer. In this bilayer, the hydrophobic fatty acid tails format themselves to make up the inner part of the bilayer as a source of protection from the intracellular and extracellular fluid surrounding the cell. The hydrophilic phosphate groups form "heads" that make up the outer half of the bilayer. This phospholipid bilayer allows the cellular membrane to be selectively permeable and assist fat soluble substances to enter or leave the cell.
Phospholipids as well act as an emulsifier, allowing fats to be mixed in blood and other body fluids. Lecithin is a common phospholipid used for its emulsifying abilities.
Sterols
Sterols are a class of lipids with a hydrocarbon ring structure. They are derived from alcohol and contain a multiple ring structure, thus deriving the name "sterol". Cholesterol, for example, is made from a hydrocarbon ring structure. Cholesterol is the most common sterol typical sources are eggs and cheese. Other sources of cholesterol are meats, seafood, poultry, other dairy products and plant-derived foods. However, cholesterol derived from plant foods are a very insignificant amount compared to those derived from animal foods. Plant foods normally contain a different type of sterol structurally similar to cholesterol called “phytosterols”. These plant sterols interfere with cholesterol absorption in the intestine and can help in the reduction of blood cholesterol as a result.
The main function of sterols is as a precursor to other compounds found in the body. Cholesterol, for example, is used to synthesize vitamin D within the body. Other compounds include the bile acids, sex hormones, and adrenal hormones. Sterols also make-up part of the cellular membrane, serving a structural role.
Digestion and Absorption of Lipids
The digestion and absorption of lipids differs from that of both carbohydrates and proteins. Unlike the other nutrients, lipids are not water soluble and therefor require a more advanced process in order to be broken down and absorbed by the body (Bowen, 2015). Digestion of lipids begins in the mouth and stomach, however most of lipid digestion takes place in the small intestine (King, 2015). Bile, which is made in the liver, begins the digestion of lipids by physically breaking them down into smaller molecules. By doing so, it is easier for lipase to begin chemically breaking down lipids. Lipase is a pancreatic enzyme that is responsible for the digestion of lipids (Bowen, 2015). Lipase breaks the lipids down into free fatty acid and monoglyceride molecules to make absorption easier. Absorption of the digestive products occurs in the small intestine. The molecules left over from hydrolysis are absorbed into mucosal cells that line the walls of the intestines. Absorption occurs through either simple diffusion or with assistance from other transports (King, 2015).
Lipid Associated Diseases
[
]
High levels of lipids in the bloodstream, particularly LDL and triglycerides, can increase a person’s risk of developing coronary heart disease. Part of this is due to the fact that the body must create more capillaries in order to supply blood to excess fatty tissue. This causes the heart to work harder, increasing strain and thus the chances of developing disease.
The condition of having consistently high lipid levels in the blood is known as hyperlipidemia, and it can lead to other health problems such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart disease, and stroke.
If left untreated, high lipid levels can lead to plaque accumulation on artery walls. Plaque is made up of lipids, such as fat and cholesterol, as well as calcium and other blood substances.
Oxidized lipids can increase the amount of calcium that is deposited on artery walls, constricting blood flow and increasing the chance of an interruption.
Small LDL particles are more likely to oxidize, and patients with large numbers of small LDL particles in their system have a higher risk of developing health complications, including diabetes.
Reduced arterial blood flow can also cause problems such as angina (chest pain) or even a heart attack. In cases of heart attack, blood flow is completely cut off from a section of the heart muscle, which can ultimately lead to serious complications or patient death if left untreated.
Hyperlipidemia can be treated with therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as reducing the amount of dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and increasing intake of soluble fiber and plant sterols.
High levels of LDL in the blood can be reduced with various treatments. Weight loss is often recommended, as the reduction of excess weight can lower levels of LDL. Additionally, foods derived from soybeans, such as tofu and various other meat replacements, contain a specific antioxidant compound that can help decrease LDL levels. In more extreme cases, however, a patient may be prescribed lipid-reducing medications, such as statins, fibrates, and compounds that prevent the body from reabsorbing the cholesterol found in bile acid. Niacin can also be used to help reduce LDL levels.
High triglyceride levels in the body can also be an issue. Diabetic patients are more likely to have high triglyceride levels. This is partly due to the effects of insulin on lipid flux regulation.
Triglyceride levels can be lowered by eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold-water fish like salmon and sardines.
In contrast with LDL and triglycerides, high levels of HDL can actually lower the chances of developing heart disease.
Excess body weight and smoking are both known to lower HDL levels.
Hypercholesterolemia
Excessive cholesterol in the blood can lead to coronary heart disease and disease of the arteries.  Of major concern is when blood levels are high in LDL cholesterol and trigylcerides, and low levels of HDL cholesterol.
Heart Attack
Micronutrient Basics
[
]
Micronutrients are commonly known as vitamins and minerals. They are called micronutrients because the body only requires a very small quantity of vitamins and minerals to assist the body in its normal functions.  These nutrients are essential to our bodies, however our bodies are unable to produce micronutrients and they must be sourced from our diets.  To gain the essential nutrients we need it is important to eat a well balanced diet that includes a range of colorful fruit and vegetables, nuts and whole grains. That way we gain such vitamins as Vitamins C to aid the immune system, Vitamin E to help fight free radical damage, or minerals such as Iron for red cell production and Calcium for strong healthy bones.
The
World Health Organisation
calls micronutrients "the 'magic wands' that enable the body to product enzymes, hormones and other substances essential for proper growth and development".  The
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
has a program called 'Improving Nutrition through Nuclear Sciences', IAEA understands the essential role micronutrients play in our bodies and states "when micronutrients are not sufficient from food in the diet, significant health problems can result" and a significant amount of research has gone into understanding the physiological role and the health consequences of micronutrient deficiencies. Joint experts, the
World Health Organisation
and the
Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations
conducted research in 1998 to establish clear parameters of defining micronutrients deficiencies for public health, as well as to develop preventative action and control strategies.
Vitamins
[
]
There are a total of thirteen essential organic vitamins in the body which include Vitamin A,C,D,E,K,B1,B2,B3,B6,B12,pantothenic acid,biotin, and folic acid. These are used on a daily basis for tasks around your body you wouldn't even think of. Certain vitamins are used to see in dim light or make sex hormones and without them, we wouldn't function properly. Vitamins are unique in the fact that they denature by heat, light, and chemical agents. They need to be intact in order for them to work properly.
Fat Soluble Vitamins
The fat-soluble vitamins which mean they are soluble in lipids, include A,D,E, and K.
They are dissolved in fat before they are absorbed into the bloodstream where they reach the rest of the body and carry out many different functions.  Consuming too many of these vitamins can actual increase the toxicity of your body and become dangerous. However these vitamins are essential and contribute to things such as your eye health, antioxidants to cancer, strong bones, blood clotting and lower risk of heart disease.
Water Soluble Vitamins
Water soluble vitamins are more easily dissolved in water compared to fat-soluble, and are constantly needing them to be replenished in our body since they are eliminated via urine. Therefore, we get a lot of these vitamins through our diet. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C as well as the vitamin B complex.
Something unique to water-soluble vitamins is the actual vitamins can be lost or destroyed if food isn't prepared properly. For example, keeping milk and grains in sunlight for an extended period of time can denature water-soluble vitamins.
Minerals
[
]
Minerals are inorganic materials that are essential for different functions and growth in your body, however they do not give energy.
Although there are 16 essential minerals found in the human body, research is constantly trying to prove more exist and are essential. Among other functions, minerals contribute to bone and teeth production, immune health, nerve and muscle function and more. Unlike vitamins, minerals are inorganic so they are technically indestructible and do not need to be handled with such care as vitamins do. However, some minerals can bind to certain substances that make it difficult for the body to absorb them. The two types of minerals, major and trace, are described below.
Major Minerals
The major minerals include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, chloride and sulfur. These are called "major" minerals. This is not because they are more important than trace minerals, but because they are needed in larger amounts than trace minerals. Major minerals contribute to processes such as proper fluid balance, healthy bones and teeth, nerve and muscle communication, and more.
Trace Minerals
Trace minerals include iron, copper, zinc, manganese, fluoride, selenium, and cobalt. As mentioned earlier, these minerals are not less important than the major minerals but the human body simply needs a lesser amount. Trace minerals contribute to red blood cell function, thyroid hormone production, are part of enzymes, regulate blood glucose, and many more.

1.2 Nutritional Science
[

1.2.1 Nutrition as a Science
[
]
Nutritional science is the study of how food affects humans and animals on a physiological level. Nutrition is a necessity in order to preserve the life of organisms and cells. It examines how food is processed, responded to, and utilized throughout the body. Nutrition is widely related to as how food follows certain biochemical sequences and transformations – metabolism and its various pathways. Through these studies it also allows researchers to understand how certain diseases and conditions are contributed to from the dietary habits of individuals. It is important to understand the science of nutrition because nutrition is at the core of all processes of life. An individual who studies nutrition is referred to as a nutritionist. This is sometimes interchangeable with a dietician, but it is to be noted that they are not the same. Dietetics is the interpretation and presentation of nutritional science to make it possible for informed rational choices pertaining to an individual’s lifestyle and food in both health and disease.
Nutritional science answers questions like:
How can a change in diet help people with medical conditions?
How does food contribute the body’s daily functions and mechanisms?
What is considered a healthy diet?
How much minerals, vitamins, and macronutrients does a person have to consume daily?
There are 3 factors that helped contribute to the understanding of essential nutrients; how diseases are associated with a person’s diet, how animal models can be used to pinpoint parts of a diet and associate it with disease symptoms, and the development of experimental diets that would investigate deficiency symptoms.
1.2.2 Nutrition Research

Epidemiological Studies
[
]
Epidemiology is the study of how often diseases occur in various populations and why they occur. Epidemiological studies are conducted in order to strategize how to prevent and manage these illnesses in those who have already developed it. An important factor in epidemiological studies is how it measures disease outcomes in relation to a population at risk. A population at risk is defined as a group of people, healthy or sick, who are accounted for in cases if they had the diseases being studied
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases spread and how they can be controlled throughout different populations through the use of patterns in health. Epidemiological studies are thus done on selected groups of people to allow researchers to study and learn to control the diseases. These studies are oftentimes known to generate hypotheses because while they collect data, they are not actually testing certain subjects, but observing them and cannot prove causation. The researchers observe each population with no intervention other than asking questions or carrying out simple lab tests to collect data over time (Pearce,2012). Divided into two main groups depending on whether the events are retrospective or prospective (“Epidemiology”,1993), the most common types of these studies are cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional and researchers decide on which type of study they want to use based off of their goals and constraints (such as time or costs). Cohort studies compare similar populations that have different exposures to what the researcher is interested to see whether or not the disease in question’s likelihood grows with the amount of exposure (Spears, not dated). An advantage to this type of study is that it takes place over a long period of time and ask people to keep track of their daily activities so the data can also be used to study other types of diseases. Along with that, the presence of a disease can be verified. However, a downside would be that there would need to be a large amount of participants willing to continue the study for a long period of time in order to find out if there really is a correlation between the amount of exposure and the risk of disease and the cost of this type of study would be the most expensive.  The second common type of study is the case control study. In these studies, the researchers are comparing data from people who have the disease and people who do not have the disease. These studies are good when studying rare diseases because they are inexpensive and do not take long to be completed. On the other hand, the reliability of the researchers for recall is very low and it could be hard to actually compare the different data from subjects. Cross-sectional studies compare data from small groups of people and focus on observations made at only one point in time (Spears, not dated). These studies are relatively inexpensive and do not take long to complete, however they cannot reveal a sequences of events since data is only taken once. An example of a cross sectional study would be to compare the rate of a particular disease in two different places.
During the process of epidemiological studies, individuals are questioned about their current and past diet history. Epidemiological studies may also measure the levels of substances such as vitamins or minerals in blood or urine and attempt to correlate these levels with diet or health. The major strength of epidemiological studies is that they are able to look at large groups of people for a long period of time. People from more than one region or more than one country can be included. People of different ages, genders, andethnic origins can be studied. Epidemiological studies look at people, so the results of these studies are directly applicable to humans and do not have to be extrapolated from cells or animals. On the other hand, there are limitations to epidemiological studies, particularly those that are based on people's descriptions of what they eat. There are various tools available for scientists to collect this information, but all have some limitations. They all rely on the subjects to describe accurately what they eat. Finding results from these types of studies can be difficult because it is difficult for the subject to fully describe everything they have consumed and the exact quality. When addressing epidemiological studies, there are various types that scientists can utilize.
Case-Control Studies: These studies look at the characteristics of two groups of people. The comparison is made between the experimental group, (those who already have a certain health outcome) and to the control group (a similar group of people who do not have the outcome). While case-control studies can be done quickly and relatively cheaply, they aren’t ideal for studying diet because they gather information from the past. People with illnesses often recall past behaviors differently from those without illness. This opens such studies to potential inaccuracy and bias in the information they gather.
Cohort Studies
: These studies follow large groups of people over a long period of time. Researchers regularly gather information from the people in the study on a variety of dietary variables. When a specified amount of time has elapsed, the characteristics of people in the group are recorded to test the validity of the experiment’s hypothesis. Though time-consuming and expensive, cohort studies generally provide more reliable information than case-control studies because they don’t rely on information from the past. Cohort studies gather the information all along and before anyone develops the disease being studied. As a group, these types of studies have provided valuable information about the link between lifestyle factors and disease.
Randomized Trials
: These studies are similar to cohort studies in the case that they follow a group of people over time. However, with randomized trials, the researchers actually intervene to see how a specific behavior change or treatment, for example, affects a health outcome. They are called “randomized trials” because people in the study are randomly assigned either to receive or not receive the intervention. This randomization helps researchers hone in on the true effect the intervention has on the health outcome. However, randomized trials also have drawbacks, especially when it comes to diet. While they are good at looking at topics like vitamin supplements and cancer, when the change in diet is more involved than say taking a vitamin pill, participants begin to have trouble keeping to their prescribed diets. Such involved interventions can also become very expensive
Cell Studies
[
]
Cells are the fundamental units of life and are the smallest components considered inside the human body.These body cells are constantly communicating with each other, responding to the environment and to the signals they receive from a person's five senses. If the cells cannot operate efficiently, the functioning of the tissues and organs the cells make up, will become compromised. As a result, a person can experience a diminishment of physical functioning and the onset of a host of health conditions and diseases. By keeping a person's cells well nourished, the individual will also be well nourished.
Cells are analyzed in laboratories to look for the presence of diseases and to understand how it actively effects cells. Cells can be collected from urine, blood, and through the process of scraping the surface of organs. Cell studies are conducted to see what types of cells there are based on their appearance and characteristics. The study of cells, including their origin, function, and structure is known as cytology. The analysis of cells is referred to as cytopathology.
Animal Studies
[
]
Animal studies have highly contributed to our current knowledge of metabolism and nutrition through the experimentation of other species besides humans; these experiments predict what might happen in the physiology of humans. Animal studies have been utilized to solve nutrition x nutrient interactions, bioavailability of nutrients and its precursors, and nutrient tolerance and toxicity levels
Before animal experiments, people were already beginning to understand how certain foods and their elements affected health. For example, scurvy had developed amongst sailors in the 1800’s, and it was discovered that scurvy developed due to a lack of food that contained citrus, like limes (Baker 2008). Nutritional scientist took it further by using animal studies to understand how minerals, vitamins and macronutrients can develop into diseases, deficiencies, and toxicities.  David H. Baker’s journal explains and gives examples of how nutritional scientist use animals to understand the elements of nutrition.
The types of animals used in these studies are generally rats, pigs, dogs, cats, farm animals, rabbits, and primates. Animal testing is viewed as a way for medical progress without harming people. Dogs were used in animal models that helped understand the role of the pancreas and insulin, and how pellagra develops from a deficiency of specific foods. However these experiments can give faulty data, due to the effects of the experiment giving different results for specific species (Baker 2008). In one experiment, rats, chicks, dogs, cats, and pigs were used to see how amino acids could have a negative affect on one another (Baker, 2008).  In the experiment lysine affected arginine in chicks and dogs, but not for pigs and cats, which leads to the question, will this also be the same for humans (Baker 2008)?
Animal Welfare Act
Animal studies are often a controversial topic; there is always a fear for the animal’s well being. In the U.S., one can rest assured that the government has taken this into consideration; there are laws and regulations on behalf of the animal’s welfare. The Animal Welfare Act is a law that protects animals from maltreatment and sets minimum requirements for housing and care (Animal Welfare Act, 2015). Animals are not used strictly for human benefit, but also to better their future as well. In animal studies, scientists learn more about the species, which leads to advances in the animal’s care.
Benefits and Advantages
There are a plethora of benefits from animal studies, some of which include the eradication of nutrient deficiency diseases in most countries. With the advances being made in technology along with the usefulness of animal studies, this will lead to the understanding of the affects of diets on diseases, reproduction, brain function, and even longevity. There are also benefits in animal studies in a general sense: more economical for larger group studies, easy to control and monitor dietary consumption and living conditions, short life spans improve the practicality and efficiency of developmental, longevity, or multiple generation studies, and controlled breeding reduces biological variability. Of course, the most obvious advantage is that this safer for humans, but thanks to the Animal Welfare Act, this demands that an ethical approach be taken towards the animals.
Procedures
Scientists do not just use any animal for their research. Specifically for nutritional studies, a great deal of research is put into strategically choosing an animal model (Baker, 2003). Scientists need their animal model’s diet, nutrient metabolism, and requirements to be similar to humans in order for the studies to be applicable to human nutrition. For example, humans have the uncommon requirement for vitamin C. For studies on vitamin C, scientists often look to use guinea pigs that also have this uncommon requirement. More often than not, rats are the go-to animal models for human nutrition. Rats share human’s omnivorous eating pattern, which makes them better candidates for nutrition studies (Macrae, 1993).
Application
Most vitamins were actually discovered through animal studies, simply by changing the animal’s diet. Animal studies in nutrition have prevented diseases due to deficiencies and even the eradication of some food preparation methods. For example, nitrogen trichloride bleaching used to bleach flour was discontinued for human consumption after the incidental discovery that it causes hysteria in dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits. Animal models have led to the discovery of gastric juice, essential amino acids, and matched deficiency diseases and symptoms with the lacking vitamin (Macrae, 1993).
Human Studies
[
]
Human studies are conducted to test the safety and efficiency of specific treatments. They are designed to improve health and quality of life for patients, however, there is a risk that patients will be given treatments that do not work or may even be detrimental to health. Clinical trials are carried out in many stages or phases. Phase 1 is when a new treatment is developed and tested within a few individuals to estimate how safe it is. The treatment is usually given to all those who take part in it, rather than being compared against another form of treatment. Phase 2 treatment focuses on a larger population of people to effectively measure out safety, possible side-effects, or positive effects patients may experience. Phase 2 can involve comparison with another treatment, but does not have to. Phase 3 trials are tested within a large population as well and compare the effects of newer drugs or treatments with standard treatments. Phase 3 trials are typically randomized clinical trials. In these trials one group of people, the experimental group, is given the new treatment, while the other, the control group, is given the standard treatment or a placebo; some phase 3 trials may compare more than two groups
1.2.3 Analyzing Research Data
[
]
Analyzing research data allows researchers to answer questions about specific conditions or diseases – such as its distribution, possible causes and correlations, and related issues. This makes it possible to create and monitor specific procedures that may improve the situation
Motivation for Data Analysis
Data analysis by use of statistical methods developed for the human sciences is an essential step in drawing conclusions about human nutritional trials and other nutritional research activities. A properly conducted statistical analysis summarizes collected data in a meaningful, unbiased manner, so long as the experiment and data collection were conducted in the same vein.
In the nutritional sciences, the final product of data analysis is used to gain a quantitative understanding of nutrients and their interactions with humans. This information is used to inform public health policy on important nutritional guidelines, recommendations, and safe levels of consumption. In releasing their 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) received recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which compiled many scientific journals using statistical analysis (USDOH, 2015).
Basic Categories of Data Analysis
Data analysis in any discipline (economics, epidemiology, sociology, etc.) falls into two basic categories: descriptive and inferential statistics.
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics aims to summarize collected data in a meaningful way. A descriptive analysis reveals certain properties and characteristics about the collected data, but does not extrapolate or make predictions about trends if the experiment were conducted in different environments with different conditions. Properties such as central tendencies (mean and median), data patterns (mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), distributional qualities (normal, uniform, gamma) give researchers an initial insight into important qualities about the data. This also gives researchers an opportunity to find errors in the data collection process or biases in the research method used to collect the data.
Inferential Statistics
Also known as predictive statistics, inferential statistics uses collected data from a sample (a small group of people) to make predictions or extrapolations about the entire relevant population. Inferential statistics is also used to find whether an event occurred purely by chance, or was possibly caused (correlated) by a preceding event.
Hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and confidence interval estimation are all examples of methods in inferential statistics. In a hypothesis test, nutritional researchers might use a statistical test to determine whether a treatment given to a Group A (called the treatment group) is significantly different from a placebo given to another (control) Group B. Significantly different, or statistically significant, means the hypothesis test has rejected the notion that the effect of the treatment on Group A is the same as a placebo on Group B. In laymen’s terms, the treatment is statistically effective. It is important to understand that a statistically significant result does not translate to an actual difference in the treatment’s effect on any population. See Disadvantages of Data Analysis.
Disadvantages and Challenges of Data Analysis
Experiments and epidemiological analyses are never perfect. In the realm of nutritional science, there are many inherent ethical, legal, and logistical restrictions placed on research and collection of data. Other problems arise when statistics is used to prove questionable or unethical reasons, such as proving a drug or remedy is effective when in fact it is not. Still other issues arise when the wrong statistical tools are used, or these tools are used by those inexperienced with statistical analysis. There are many other issues and challenges that arise, and so this list is not all inclusive.
Biased Samples
Strict and correct use of statistical tools are futile if the sample used to draw descriptions and inferences is not representative of the relevant population. This bias can occur intentionally or unintentionally. Sometimes legal or ethical considerations prevent researchers from correctly composing the sample.
Incorrect Use of Statistical Tools, or Using Incorrect Tools
There are many tools in statistics that have a more effective counterpart based on the situation. There are tools used to correct the problem of drawing inferences on smaller than usual sample sizes, tools for making inferences on data that don’t follow a normal distribution, among many others. Inexperience or lack of prudence usually results in incorrect and often misleading predictions.
Missing Data and Data Replacement
In both epidemiological and experimental research, there is near certainty that some data will not lend itself to collection or measurement. Sometimes, proxy variables will be used as a surrogate to missing data. Test scores, for example, may be used in place of IQ scores. However, if researchers are not prudent in their proxy selection, they may skew the data (Hall, 2004).

1.3.1 Early Epidemiological Findings
[
]
Disease Theories
[
]
Some disease theories:
1. The miasma theory (also called the miasmatic theory) held that diseases such as cholera, chlamydia or the Black Death were caused by a miasma (Μίασμα, ancient Greek: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air". The theory held that the origin of epidemics was due to a miasma, emanating from rotting organic matter. The miasma theory was accepted from ancient times in Europe, India and China. The theory was eventually displaced in the 19th century by the discovery of germs and the germ theory of disease.
Unlike the multifactorial causation theory of disease, the germ theory doesn’t account for factors that were essential in early understandings of health and disease like diet, ventilation and climate.
2. Germ theory states that many diseases are caused by the presence and actions of specific micro-organisms within the body. The theory was developed and gained gradual acceptance in Europe and the United States from the middle 1800s. It eventually superseded existing miasma and contagion theories of disease and in so doing radically changed the practice of medicine. It remains a guiding theory that underlies contemporary biomedicine.
3. The supernatural theory of disease holds that obtaining a disease is a cause of punishment casted upon a person by various gods, ghosts, demons and evil spirits. Since the causative agents of these diseases were in fact supernatural, different forms of magic were a big factor and maybe even the only factor in diagnosis and treatment or cure. Depending on the culture, there are different members of society (usually men), who people look to as the ones who can heal them from their disease. These members are called shamans, medicine men, diviners and priests and they are thought of so highly because of their perceived special relationship to these supernatural agents. These healers used various methods in ridding these diseases; magic spells, exorcism, divination and drugs that would nauseate the person. Modern medicine has proven some of these theories wrong or lacking in one way or another, but there are still many people whose beliefs of the supernatural world persist with modern medicine. Still though, in a lot of modern vocabulary, when we speak of illness and disease we say things that reflect the very ideas and actions of the supernatural world. A person might say that they were “attacked” by a disease, of that they have to “fight off” infection until it is “expelled” or “out of” their bodies; things that those healers in different cultures would say that they were doing. Until the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, traces of older. Supernatural explanations for disease coexisted with the speculations about miasma or “bad air” and contagion.
4. The multifactorial causation theory holds the idea that all diseases have multiple factors and causes. It states that disease is a result of an agent, the host and the surrounding environment. This theory helps us to identify causative factors and suggest ways to prevent the diseases by modifying the factors that influence the exposure if it. In contrast to agents in the supernatural theory of disease, agents here are biological, chemical and physical factors and also need to be present for any kind of disease to occur. As for the host, factors that come into play are personal characteristics and behaviors, genetic endowment and predisposition, the status if your immune system and anything else that influences susceptibility. As for the environmental factors, they are any other external conditions besides the agent that influences the onset of a disease.
Food Cures
[
]
The pattern of the discovery of vitamins over time consisted of different food sources being found to cure certain diseases, and a closer analysis of those food sources in order to figure out what component of them was doing the actual curing.  In fact, the actual term “vitamin” didn’t come into existence until 1910 when a Polish biochemist by the name of Casimir Funk made the discovery that there were certain vital amines that were needed by the body and only supplied by certain foods.  Without these vital amines, people and animals would suffer from diseases of deficiency.  By combining the terms “vital” and “amine,” he created the term “vitamin” (Carpenter).  There are many diseases of deficiency of a certain vitamin, and the foods that were first found to cure them are discussed in the writing below.
One example of this pattern of discovery was with scurvy, which was the first disease ever identified to have a direct association with a food deficiency (Rosenfeld). Scurvy is a disease characterized by weakness, blood spots on the body, joint pain, loosened teeth, and can potentially lead to death.  In the 19th century, many sailors developed scurvy when they went on twelve week long trips at sea and only had access to dry foods for nourishment in that whole duration of time.  Upon arrival back on land, they were usually able to be cured of the disease within a week or so by consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.   It was later discovered that vitamin C was the curing component of the fruits and vegetables (Carpenter).  Another example of this is beriberi, a disease that was found to be quite common among people who consumed a diet of milled rice and not much of anything else.  In the 1890s, a physician by the name of Christian Eijkman began taking a closer look at the issue in Java. He found that non-milled brown rice didn’t seem to cause nearly as many instances of beriberi, and it was later discovered that this was due to the fact that brown rice contained the vitamin thiamin (Carpenter).  In 1914, Joseph Goldberg sought to figure out the deficiency that caused pellagra, which was originally thought to be caused by an infection rather than a diet issue (Semba).  Upon figuring out that yeast supplements were able to cure the disease.  It was later discovered in 1933 that the yeast supplements contained the vitamin niacin, which was the curing component of them (Carpenter).  Then, in 1934, three men by the names of George Whipple, George Minot, and William Murphy discovered that people suffering from pernicious anemia were able to be cured from the disease by consuming very large amounts of liver on a daily basis.  Twelve years later, in 1948, it was then found that vitamin B12 was the component of liver that was curing the pernicious anemia (Carpenter).  Then again in 1943, two scientists by the names of Henrik Dam and Edward Doisy wanted to figure out how to cure many birds of a certain population that were experiencing severe internal hemorrhages and lacking a blood clotting mechanism to help the issue.  The scientists found that the birds were cured when they consumed green leaves, as well as liver.  It was later discovered that these foods were great sources of vitamin K, which was actually curing the issues (Carpenter).
1.3.2 Barriers to Discovery
[
]
Two major barriers to the discovery of vitamins and minerals were the assumptions made about food, and the lack of basic research into challenging these assumptions. These assumptions included the ideas that all kinds of protein were considered equally effective, and that fat also was interchangeable.
Before the importance of vitamins and minerals was widely known, afflictions such as beriberi, pellagra, and scurvy were assumed to be infections. The primary theory to the cause of what we now know as vitamin deficiencies was germ theory, where “diseases [are] caused by infectious organisms or toxins produced by these organisms.
Another assumption that needed to be challenged was the idea that there were “four essential elements of nutrition: proteins, carbohydrates, fat, and minerals”.
Around the turn of the nineteenth century, scientists started research into these deficiencies. The earliest study took place in 1881, with Nikolai Lunin investigating the components of milk. He noticed that when mice were fed on the individual components, they died, and when they were fed whole milk they survived. Lunin declared that “mice […] are unable to live on proteins, fats, carbohydrates, salts, and water, it follows that other substances indispensable for nutrition must be present in milk”.
In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman discovered the cause of beriberi was not bacterial in nature, as previously assumed, but instead the natural result of a thiamin deficiency from the consumption of polished white rice. He found this while working with chickens that were becoming ill from a diet of polished rice. By eliminating other suspects, such as contamination, infection, and toxins, he was able to narrow down the cause to the polishing of the rice itself, which removed valuable nutrients.
Therefore, beriberi could be reversed by the consumption of unpolished brown rice, which contains thiamin.
Today, most white rice is enriched with thiamin to prevent thiamin deficiency.
An investigation into pellagra was conducted in 1914 by Joseph Goldberger. Assumed to be an infection, Goldberger doubted this theory as none of the medical workers had caught the disease from their patients. He discovered that pellagra was cured when diets were supplemented with eggs and milk, which are high in niacin.
Scurvy is caused by the deficiency of vitamin C, and can be treated by consuming citrus fruits. This was initially discovered by James Lind in the mid-1700s. However, vitamin C crystals weren’t isolated from lemon juice until 1932 by Charles Glen King, with the modern technology he had available.
1.3.3 Economics of Nutritional Deficiency
[
]
Over 1/3 of the world population has a vitamin and mineral deficiency of some sort. Studies have shown that deficiencies in both macronutrients and micronutrients effect work output. So when a country has a population with a high nutrient deficiency it affects their economic prosperity.  This is due to deficiencies causing reduced intellectual development and weakened immune systems. There is a positive correlation between one’s nutrition and economic outcome. If we think about it, those countries with higher incomes are more likely to have richer diets. They have the income to buy foods that meet all their dietary needs. Any nutrients they are deficient in are due to poor choices. Developing countries who have higher malnutrition rates have more health issues, which sets back their economic progress. The healthier a person is the more energy they will have. This allows them to be more productive in their daily lives and have a higher economic output. Also by not having any nutritional deficiencies you are less likely to get diseases and mortality rates will decrease.
As previously mentioned, both macronutrients and micronutrients have a major influence on one’s work output. So deficiencies in either can decrease their work output, affecting their economic prosperity.  An example of this is when people are deficient in protein. This affects transport of other essential nutrients around the body; this leads to a series of effects throughout the body.  The deficiency of protein can cause your body to become deficient in various nutrients since your body cannot transport them effectively.
Iron deficiencies also have major impacts on work capacity. Iron plays a role in transporting oxygen throughout the body. So when you have low iron levels , oxygen levels decrease because they cannot be transported throughout the body. This causes the body to feel fatigued and one will not be as productive in their work.  Studies have shown that once give supplements, those deficient in iron were given supplements their work productivity increased by 20%.
There are inexpensive and effective solutions to decrease nutrient deficiencies around the world. According to UNICEF 4 easy solutions are food fortification, supplements, education, and disease control. For food fortification, nutrients that countries have high rates of deficiency in can be added into certain foods like flour and sugar. For supplements, those people who are highly in need of certain nutrients can be given tablets or capsules with essential vitamins and minerals. Disease control can be met by treating diseases that affect the body’s absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. All these possible solutions would cost only a few cents a year per person. The benefits of these solutions outweigh the costs. If nutrient deficiencies decrease there would be less diseases and mortality rates, especially among the children. This allows people to have higher work outputs, ultimately helping their economic prosperity.
1.3.4 Discovery of Vitamins
[
]
Carimir Funk first created the term “vitamine” in 1912, not too long after he discovered the first vitamin. Funk was able to isolate and concentrate a substance from bran that had the ability to cure beriberi, specifically in pigeons. He found that this substance was considered an amine and that it was important for a healthy diet; this substance was later termed “thiamine” (also known as Vitamin B).
His discovery allowed physicians to realize that many diseases thought to be the result of infection (including beriberi, scurvy, pellagra, and rickets) were instead arising due to vitamin deficiencies.
Key researchers
[
]
Joseph Goldberger and Niacin: Between 1914 and 1929 Goldberger investigated the true cause of pellagra, which is a disease that results in severe skin eruptions, diarrhea, and mental changes thought to be caused by an infection possibly from insects. Goldberger believed that the cause of these symptoms was not due to an infection; he even ate miniscule amounts of skin from people suffering from pellagra to prove that the infection theory was false. After his death in 1929, the group that was working with him continued his research and by 1935 it was discovered that pellagra was due to a deficiency in nicotinic acid (also known as “niacin”).
Albert Szent-Györgyi and Vitamin C: He received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine due to his discovery of Vitamin C. Ironically, Szent-Györgyi discovered what he called “hexuronic acid” in 1928 and did not realize that he had isolated Vitamin C. By 1932, when Charles Glen King reported his discovery of Vitamin C, it ended up having the same chemical formula of Szent-Györgyi’s hexuronic acid; Szent-Györgyi was acknowledged for the discovery, even though he did not necessarily realize what he had discovered initially.
Henrik Dam and Vitamin K: He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, along with Edward Doisy, for his discovery of Vitamin K. After studying internal hemorrhaging in chicks caused by a faulty clotting mechanism, he discovered that adding a factor found in the liver and green leaves would resolve the problem and the component was named Vitamin K.
Sir Edward Bellanby and Vitamin D: Vitamin D is thought of as the “sunshine vitamin” because various materials synthesize it when they are exposed to sufficient sunlight (McDowell, 2000, p. 91). During the early 1900s, a British doctor known as Sir Edward Mellanby was conducting a research to find a cure for rickets. Rickets is the weakening of bones in children due to vitamin D deficiency. Mellanby began his experiment by producing rickets in dogs. He basically fed the dogs with oatmeal and kept them indoors. Oatmeal was a common diet from the people that encountered rickets. In 1922 he succeeded in producing the disease in the dogs which was similar to the human disease (McDowell, 2000, p. 92). Then he provided the dogs with cod liver oil and had an assumption that vitamin A is the cure for rickets. Elmer McCollum, an American researcher who was one of the people that was responsible for the discovery of the fat-soluble vitamin A decided to test Mellanby assumption. McCollum bubbled oxygen through cod liver oil and heated it to destroy the vitamin A activity, but the properties of cod liver oil in prevention and cure of rickets remained (McDowell, 2000, p. 92-93). In 1922, he came to a conclusion that this vitamin is a new fat-soluble vitamin and he called it vitamin D.
Elmer McCollum and Vitamin A: In human nutrition, vitamin A is one of the few vitamins of which both deficiency and excess constitute a serious health hazard (McDowell, 2000, p. 15). People have suffered from a lack of vitamin A for a very long time. Due to vitamin A deficiency, people would go through conditions like night blindness and dry eyes. Before the discovery of vitamin A, this condition was unknown. In 1912, a biochemist named Frederick Gowland Hopkins found unknown factors present in milk that were not protein, fat, or carbohydrate (Vitamin A History, 2015). A few years later, an American researcher, Elmer McCollum and his college graduate volunteer, Marguerite Davis did a test on rats by feeding them milk, olive oil, and lard. They notice that the rats that were fed with milk are showing growth while the rats that were fed with olive oil and lard started to show no growth after a nice start. At that point, McCollum and Davis knew that they had discovered a phenomenon and the secret is in the milk. To prove their discovery McCollum and Davis extracted the fat-soluble from the milk. After that they would add the stuff that they extracted into the olive oil and lard, which is then fed to the rats. The rats that consumed the new olive oil and lard had the same growth rate as the rats that drank the milk. McCollum would name it as fat-soluble factor A, which is now known as vitamin A.
Identification
[
]
Vitamins can be removed from oils through a process called molecular distillation; as the temperature increases fractions containing high levels of the vitamin are removed and reach their maximum point. The ideal elimination curve is easily recognizable due to its slightly skewed shape. Whenever there are deviations from the shape, this indicates either the presence of multiple forms of the vitamin or imperfect conditions of distillation, which allows for the specific identification of the vitamin.
Isolation
[
]
The isolation of vitamins is important when dealing with a vitamin that may come in multiple forms. Specifically the isolation of Vitamin K is necessary because it is found in two forms (K1 and K2). The isolation of these two forms was found through multiple techniques including the recovery of crystals after various factors were added, comparing the UV absorption spectra, and preparing several different batches to compare melting point and potency. It was discovered that Vitamin K1 comes from alfalfa and changes from light yellow oil into a crystalline condition after the cooling of an acetone solution. Vitamin K2 is a light yellow crystalline solid that comes from putrefied sardine meal. It is important to isolate Vitamin K because of its various effects on coagulation.

Average Macronutrient Distribution Range
Dietary Reference Intakes
2.1 Average Macronutrient Distribution Range
[
]
Overview
[
]
The average/ acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) is the predetermined ranges of intake for specific macronutrient energy nutrients in our diet. These ranges were developed by the DRI (dietary reference index) to help society monitor their diets and stay healthy. Macronutrients are nutrients that the body consumes in large quantities each day. These nutrients are important to our body and regulating our health. The three major categories of macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. They provide us with the most energy and/ or calories. These substances are important in growth, metabolism, energy, repair of tissues, and many other functions. It is known that carbohydrates and proteins provide us with 4 kcalories per gram, while fat provides us with 9 kcalories per gram. Each of these key macronutrients plays a significant role in the functioning of our bodies and providing us with adequate nutrients to stay healthy. The dietary recommendations endorse specific percentage ranges of intake for these different energy sources within our diet, which will provide people with sufficient nutrients to promote better health and well-being. These values are used to reduce the risk of chronic diseases while making sure we obtain adequate energy and nutrients needs. They have proposed adequate intake values of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Carbohydrates should make up 45- 65% of the kcalories we eat, protein should make up 10- 35% of the kcalories we eat, and fat should constitute 20- 35% of the calories we eat. By following through with these guidelines, people have lower risks for disease and a better chance of losing weight. These guidelines were created for all of society in order to create an average range of acceptable energy intake to benefit everyone; the hope was to continue to improve the way our society eats. It is important that the composition of our diet is highly maintained and we continue to monitor our intake so we can maintain the proper amount of energy. Each of these nutrients is imperative to maintaining a proper diet and by following these national guidelines we can live a longer healthier lifestyle.
Diets require different macronutrient percent compositions in order to maintain the needs of the body. In a diet with low or no animal protein such as vegan and vegetarian, there are limits to the percentage of protein a person can acquire. The macronutrient profiles for a healthy vegan is about 10-20% range for fats and protein with a 60-70% range for carbohydrates. Keep in mind that there are micronutrients that are more scarce in these types of diets so those need to be taken into consideration. A diet that is accepting of animal meats such as fish and animal protein has more variability in the percent concentration of macronutrients. This is because animal protein has a high composition of protein and fibers. A normal range to maintain body function can vary significantly anywhere from 10-60% range for fats, 10-60% range for protein and a 10-70% range for carbohydrates. Diets on the extreme ends are being tested by people who are passionate about finding new ways to fuel their bodies more effectively. The flux in the distribution ranges of macronutrients is prominent when analyzing different cultural food and social norms. There are numerous correlations between distribution range and prominent diseases affecting a specific region in the world based on these premises. In general, there is a normal healthy range for macronutrients but there are cases where a person can function better with an “unbalanced” diet as seen by regulation. For example, Dr. Peggy Borum who is a professor here at the University of Florida runs a metabolic assessment laboratory to assess the how people with specific conditions react when to an abnormal change in macronutrient composition. This can almost be seen as a treatment because a person’s macronutrient distribution can determine whether or not they effectively go through ATP cycles all the way to preventing seizures.
Carbohydrates
[
]
According to the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) values, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, an individual should be obtaining 45 to 65 percent of the kilocalories eaten from carbohydrates. They are one of the most important sources of energy for the body and are converted into glucose, or blood sugar, in the body after digested. (MedlinePlus, 2015) Carbohydrates are a known macronutrient that plays a large role in our diet and how much energy we are able to obtain. They are needed in much bigger amounts to allow an individual to have access to constant energy that will be used to fuel the body during the day. If an individual maintains an adequate level of carbohydrates then the body will be provided with enough energy to function efficiently. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015)
While other nutrients usually vary with the age and sex of an individual, the AMDR for carbohydrates remains the same for all populations of people. If an individual is attempting to lose weight or lives an inactive lifestyle, that individual should want to eat carbohydrates at the lower end of the distribution range, near 45 percent. Athletes and fairly active individuals will do fine near the higher end of the distribution range at 65 percent. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015)
If an individual consumes a 2000 calorie diet, they would need between 900 and 1300 calories from carbohydrates or 225 to 325 grams every day. Although the IOM has provided an AMDR for all populations, they have not established one for infants in their first year of life due to a lack of clinical data for this age group. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015)
Added Sugars
Added sugars are a specific type of carbohydrate that enters the bloodstream quickly and spike an individual’s blood glucose levels. They are sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks when they are being made. Foods that are high in added sugars include fortune cookies, baked beans, ketchup, lemonade, and many others. According to the American Heart Association, added sugars have the potential to induce weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. The IOM does not provide a specific AMDR for added sugars, but they advise eating less than twenty-five percent of your total calories from these kinds of carbohydrates to reduce the risk of any negative health problems. (American Heart Association, 2014)
Fiber
Fiber is another form of carbohydrate that has many positive health functions. Dietary fiber can maintain normal blood glucose levels, promote digestive regularity, reduce blood cholesterol, and prevent intestinal blockage and has also been said to protect against colon cancer. Foods that are high in fiber include raspberries, guava, persimmon, mangoes, and many others. Just like added sugars, the IOM has not established a specific AMDR for fiber but does include an adequate intake value. Adult men should consume about 38 grams of fiber daily and adult women should consume 25 to 26 grams. (Harvard School of Public Health, 2013)
Proteins
[
]
Proteins are another important macronutrient that plays a big role in the amount of energy and nutrients we receive. Our bodies use these nutrients as a backup source for energy after all the carbohydrates have been used up. If we continue to follow through with these guidelines, our bodies will maintain more efficient function and growth.
According to the Average Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) 10-35 percent of the average adult’s daily kilocalorie intake should come from protein, which is approximately 50-175 grams per day. The average intake in the United States falls in between that range at about 80 grams per day. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults is based on a person’s body weight, so 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram (.36 gram per pound) of body weight. When a woman becomes pregnant and partakes in breastfeeding post pregnancy her daily consumption of protein needs to increase from 46 grams per day to 71 grams per day. This is due to the fact that the female body is working overtime to develop the fetus. In regards to gender, males on average need to consume more protein than women, approximately 6 grams more per day. Protein in the body is not stored, but used and broken down immediately into amino acids, which are the building blocks for all cells in the body. Due to the amino acids that make up protein, proteins serve as the major structural component in cells and also function in enzymes, membranes and sometimes as hormones.
Deficiency and Overconsumption
In developed countries, protein deficiency is rare seeing as there are many options for protein consumption, however, it does and can happen. When one does not consume enough protein kidney damage can occur, slowed growth and poor nutrient absorption in the body. A lack of protein also means a lack of amino acids, which are major components of cell production and body function. The elderly tend to be more at risk of protein deficiencies so it is recommended to them that they consume 25-35 grams of protein per meal to keep up their daily intake and reduce their likelihood of developing sarcopenia. In countries with ample amounts of protein, overconsumption is an issue and can have adverse effects including increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis as high levels of protein increase calcium exertion from the bones. Kidney disease can occur from overconsumption as well. This happens due to the fact that in high protein diets, the kidneys work harder and faster which has the possibility of leading to a faster rate of kidney deterioration.
Supplements to Dietary Intake
Many people, especially athletes, have taken or take a protein powder supplement in order to increase their protein consumption and increase muscle gain. This is not necessarily true and does not work as much as people expect it to. Unfortunately, a powder cannot provide the essential amino acid chains that dietary protein does so it does not increase performance by much. Whey protein, on the other hand, does aid in protein synthesis far better than normal protein powders and does increase performance, but nothing near what dietary protein does. Also, amino acid supplements can be dangerous to the body due to the large dosage of pure amino acids and can increase fatigue if used when working out due to the release of free-floating tryptophan.
Lipids
[
]
The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) value for lipids states that 20-35% of our energy in kcalories should come from fat. There are 9 kcalories in one gram of fat, which is significantly higher than the other macronutrients simply because the extra energy is made to be stored and used another time. Many people think that fat is only bad for you, but do not know that the main function of fat in the body is to provide energy and act as an energy reserve. When performing a vigorous exercise, like long distance running, most of the energy you are using comes from fat. Lipids are also involved in various other functions in the body, including providing insulation and protection to the body, making up cell membranes, and being a part of cell signaling pathways. In fact, fat is even needed to absorb the fat-soluble vitamins. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). The wide variety of roles that fat has in the body means that an individual needs to meet the AMDR to maintain energy and support a healthy body down to the cellular level. Following the guidelines set forth not only supply you with the energy that you need, but also prevent and reduce chronic disease. The AMDR for lipids for adults is a standard 20-35%. The only age groups that are recommended to consume more fat include children ages 4–18 who require 25-35%, and very young children ages 1–3 that need 30-40%. There are many different sources of food containing lipids, with some containing healthier fat than others (Dietary Reference Intakes” 2015). Foods like butter and animal fats are common saturated fats that should be reduced when possible. Other fats found in a variety of foods, like avocados and nuts, are healthy and support fat’s positive functions in the body. While it is okay to eat most of the different types of fat, it is very important to stay in the AMDR range to make sure that you do not adversely affect your health.
Lipids and Health
[
]
While getting enough fat in your diet is crucial, it’s very easy to eat too much of certain types and acquire serious health consequences. There are three main types of fat: saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated. While the unsaturated fats have been linked to lowering blood cholesterol, saturated fat raises it and has overwhelmingly negative effects on health. That is why, although there is no AMDR for the specific types of fat, it is recommended that no more than ten percent of your daily calories come from saturated fat (“UPHS Nutrition Care Guide: Fat in Your Diet” 2015). When a person consumes more fat and energy than they expend, the excess is stored in adipose tissue around the body, and deposits plaque to build up in the coronary arteries. This combination along with many others can lead to high blood pressure, stroke, coronary heart disease, and more (“What Are the Health Risks of Overweight and Obesity?” 2015). Limiting bad fats and increasing good fats are important to ensure that you are in the proper range to maintain a healthy body weight and good cardiovascular health. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). By looking at all of the serious health problems that can result from consuming too much fat, it is clear why the AMDR for lipids is so important.

Dietary Reference Intakes
[
]
The National Center for Biotechnology Information defines dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as reference values that are quantitative estimates of nutrients (such as vitamins, proteins, fats, and other food components, such as fiber) intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy people. Dietary reference intake values vary by age, gender, and stage of life. It includes: estimated average requirements, recommended dietary allowance, adequate intakes, and tolerable upper limits.
"Estimated average requirements (EAR)" are the intake levels for nutrients estimated to meet the needs of half of the healthy individuals in a particular group (National Agricultural Library). EAR’s are used to gauge the adequacy of the populations food supply. An additional purpose of the EAR is that they are used as the basis for calculating the recommended dietary allowances for individuals
"Recommended dietary allowance (RDA)" are the intake levels for nutrients that meet the needs of nearly all healthy individuals in a particular group (National Institutes of Health). In this particular case, nearly means 97% of the individuals in a distinct group. By meeting a RDA value an individual lowers their chance of a deficiency. Hospitals and schools use RDA values to create healthy meals by making sure an ample amount of vitamins and minerals are in each dish. RDA’s are extremely useful and they apply to most nutrients. However, there are some cases where RDA’s cannot be established because there is not enough data.  When this occurs an adequate intake is established.
"Adequate Intakes (AI)" are the approximations of the needed nutrient intakes when no RDAs exist (United States National Agricultural Library). An Adequate intake value is based on what healthy individuals typically eat, so an AI can be used as a target amount for a certain nutrient to help plan a healthy diet. People use AI’s in their everyday life when they look at different food components in a food item. For example, the fiber that is in cereal or bread.
The last set of dietary reference intakes is the "tolerable upper limit (UL)". This is the highest level of any nutrient or vitamin that nearly all the healthy people in a certain group can consume without having negative outcomes or side effects (National Institutes of Health).  This limit is created to avoid toxicity. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase. Some nutrients may not have an established UL because there is a lack of data referring to adverse side effects in a particular group.
The Dietary Reference Intakes are developed and published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The DRIs represent the most current scientific knowledge on nutrient needs of healthy populations. Another often used term for the same nutrient content is Daily Value or %DV as the content in a given food amount. The DRI system is used by both the United States and Canada and is intended for the general public and health professionals

What is the dietary reference intake, otherwise known as the DRI?  It is a collection of four reference values that include the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI), and Estimated Average Requirement (EAR). (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)  All of these values together as the DRI represent the estimated nutrient intake that is appropriate for a healthy population.  Created specifically for different gender groups and life stages, the values can vary depending on the category in which people identify with.  (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)  The values have been determined by utilizing an “expanded concept” that assesses indicators of proper health, adverse effects of overconsumption, and places an emphasis on chronic disease prevention. (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)  Thousands of studies have been taken into consideration, resulting in a system that provides recommended intakes, but also upper intake levels to avoid harm that comes with digesting too much of a nutrient.  Since these measurements are designed to meet the needs of people who are healthy and well, it is suggested that people with specific conditions are nutritional needs seek the advice or help from a health care professional. (Dobbins & Stencel, 2002)  Several Medical Health and Nutrition boards in both the United States and Canada undertook this project. (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)
The Four Categories
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the daily average intake level appropriate to meet the nutrient needs of nearly 98% of all people in a given population determined by life stage and gender.  This intake level should be utilized as a goal to meet nutritional needs.  (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)
The Estimated Average Requirement is a daily nutrient intake amount that is predicted to meet health requirements in half of the people in a given population. This value proves to not be useful when used alone, but is used to help calculate the RDA. However, when combined with an estimated variance of intake, the EAR may be used to assess the consumption of a group of people, or used when planning appropriate intake levels for a group of people.  (Beaton, 1994)
Next, the Adequate Intake (AI) should be utilized in circumstances for which there are no scientific facts to calculate the EAR.  The AI looks at the level of consumption of an observed mean nutrient intake from a population of healthy people and is experimentally derived.  It is believed that this value should either meet or exceed the appropriate nutrient amount required for every member in a healthy population.  (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)
Finally, the Tolerable Upper Intake Limit (UL) is set as the highest intake level of nutrients that is likely to pose no risk health effects to almost every individual in the general population. The more people rise above the UL, the more likely they are to experience health effect. (“Dietary Reference”, 1998) This value is important to make sure people do not consume too much of any nutrient that could result in harm to them.  (Dobbins & Stencel, 2002)
Vitamins
When determining the DRI for vitamins, several things are taken into consideration.  The goal is to determine a level in which the nutrients are able to perform their function, without side effects or excess excretion of the nutrients.  Particularly close attention has been given to the intake of choline and B vitamins to avoid the risk of developing chronic disease or developmental disabilities. (“Dietary Reference”, 1998)  The range between those two extremes is the DRI.

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) is a set of nutrient intake values for healthy people in the United States and Canada. Through completed research studies nutrition experts have standardized these numbers to define the amounts of energy, nutrients, other dietary components, and physical activity that best support health. The DRI is broken down into four categories: Estimated Average Requirements (EAR), Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), Adequate Intakes (AI), and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL).
Estimated Average Requirements
Definition: the average daily amount of a nutrient that will maintain a specific biochemical or physiological function in half the healthy people of a given age and gender group
The EAR was determined to quantify how much of a nutrient is required in the diet. The value, although subjective for each individual, is based upon factors such as the specific nutrients role in supporting activities of the body and the amount needed to reduce risks of diseases. Therefore, when comparing one individual to another, one may need more of a nutrient to maintain healthy body activities while the other may need far less to obtain the same level of functionality. By reviewing and studying entire populations, researchers were able to obtain an average that signified the amount of a nutrient needed for at least half the population.
Recommended Dietary Allowances
Definition: the average daily amount of a nutrient considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy people
The RDA was established so that a majority of the population would meet the necessary intake for nutrients. Since the EAR has a set point for that accommodates for half of the people in a population, the RDA aims to make sure almost all the population is getting enough of each nutrient. Because nutrient values differ from person to person, if everyone only consumed the EAR amount, half the population would be consistently deficient. To counter this, RDA is set near the top range to ensure that a majority of the population is meeting their proper intake. Even though some people may be consuming more of a nutrient than needed the small amounts greater than what their recommended for will do them no harm.
Adequate Intake
Definition: a value based on observed or experimentally determined approximations of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of healthy people-used when an RDA cannot be determined
The AI reflects the average amounts of a nutrient that a group of healthy people consume because there is not sufficient scientific evidence to determine an EAR for it. Therefore AI values for specific nutrients are considered tentative values while the RDA values are more concrete.
Tolerable Upper Intake Levels
Definition: the maximum daily amount of a nutrient that appears safe for most healthy people and beyond which there is an increased risk of adverse health effects
Overconsuming a particular nutrient heavily or frequently past the recommended RDA can be toxic to an individual. These high doses can lead a number of symptoms that will endanger a body’s structure and function. This is why dietary supplements and fortified foods can be dangerous to certain individuals because if taken regularly the nutrient will become toxic to body and unhealthy diseases could develop.

However, some values can account for a large portion of the population. The DRI can be divided into four subtopics that grant a more holistic understanding of what these numbers mean.
•
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR):
This category refers the average amount of a nutrient that is required to help the body maintain a healthy physiology and ensure biochemical functions continue. Due to not every person needing the same amount of nutrients from any single source, numbers vary based on gender, age, physical activity, and many other variables, so the EAR accounts for only half the population.
•
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA):
This category refers to the recommended average amount of a nutrient that adequately fulfills the dietary needs of an individual. While the EAR accounts for half the population, the RDA accounts for 98% of the population and the amount it recommends is slightly higher than the EAR. This is because consuming slightly more than the daily recommendation for a nutrient does not do nearly as much harm as slightly below, so the RDA is positioned towards the top of the overall population's estimated needs at 98%.
•
Adequate Intakes (AI):
This category substitutes for the RDA when it cannot be determined due to a lack of information pertaining to specific nutrients. This value is usually used for determining how much of a nutrient should be consumed by healthy individuals. While the AI can be used, the RDA does a better job due to it covering the majority of the population, all the while having plenty of research backing its credibility.
•
Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL):
This category deals with the point that consumption of a nutrient is likely to develop a toxicity. This means that eating too much of a nutrient can prove detrimental to one's health. The UL consists of values that mark what amount of a nutrient can prove dangerous. However, the UL is not a specific number that means you will immediately fall ill upon reaching it. The UL means that once that value is reached, the individual is at a much higher risk of encountering health complications.

1.4.2.1 Micronutrients
[

1.4.2.2 Vitamins
[
]
Vitamins are compounds that occur naturally in foods and are essential for several functions. They can be either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are metabolized and stored by the fat in your body. Water-soluble vitamins are not stored and must be consumed every day. Your body excretes the water-soluble vitamins it doesn't use. Eating a balanced diet, incorporating foods from all food groups, ensures you get all of the important vitamins you need.
1.4.2.3 Minerals
[
]
Minerals are inorganic elements that are necessary for many processes in the body.  There are two categories in which they are divided into, which are major minerals and minor minerals.  Major minerals are the essential mineral nutrients that are required by the body in relatively large amounts, which is greater than 100 milligrams daily.  Trace minerals are the essential mineral nutrients that are required by the body in relatively small amounts, which is less than 100 milligrams daily.  It is important to be familiar with the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for each of the various minerals in order to avoid toxicity symptoms that could potentially arise if taken in excessive amounts.  Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest average intake of a specific nutrient that can be taken without a risk of adverse health effects to almost all people in a general population.  In addition, as an intake rises above the UL, the risk for adverse health effects rises as well.
The necessity for setting a UL arose from the increased fortifications of foods with nutrients over time and the increased use of dietary supplementation.  It is important to remember that the UL is not a recommended level of intake, but the highest intake of a nutrient that can be tolerated by the body without any adverse health effects. Not all nutrients have a set upper limit due to insufficient data that points that specific nutrient to an adverse reaction.  Therefore, it is advisable to practice caution when consuming these nutrients in large amounts because it doesn’t mean that they can’t pose health risks.  Potassium is a mineral without a set upper limit.  Chromium is also one the minerals that doesn’t have a UL due to data insufficiencies.  There also isn’t any strong evidence that excess intake of chromium has led to an adverse health effect. Currently, the dietary intake of potassium is considerably lower than the AI in the United States and Canada.  It is especially important for increased intake amongst African Americans due to high prevalence of high blood pressure and salt sensitivity.  In a healthy population with normal kidney function, any excess potassium intake about the AI would be excreted in urine.  Therefore an UL is not established.  The UL for iron is 45 milligrams daily for adults due to the adverse effect of gastrointestinal distress.  The UL for copper is 10 milligrams daily due to the adverse effect of liver damage.  In the instance of fluoride, the UL stems from the risk of developing early signs of skeletal fluorosis.  The UL for fluoride is 10 milligrams daily.

Section 2.3: International Dietary Guidelines
International Dietary Pyramids
International dietary guidelines and dietary pyramids serve to educate groups of people about health policies, nutritious eating habits, and healthy lifestyles based on one’s distinct culture or region in which they live (Food Based Dietary Guidelines, 2015). While the USDA dietary pyramid is well recognized in the United States for North American dietary guidelines, they don’t offer much information on international dietary guidelines. So, a nonprofit company named Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust in conjunction with numerous research facilities conducted epidemiological studies and developed international dietary guidelines and pyramids for the Mediterranean, Asian, Latin, and African diets (Escobar, 1997). The multiple dietary pyramids were developed specifically in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health, The European Office of the World Health Organization, the Cornell-China-Oxford Project on Nutrition, and experts in African American and African Diasporan history (African Heritage Diet Pyramid, Asian Diet Pyramid, Latin American Diet Pyramid, Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, 2015).
The Mediterranean diet pyramid, first introduced in 1993, is now recognized as one of the best-rounded diets in terms of promoting a healthy lifestyle throughout one’s entire life. The dietary pyramid is based off of data from the dietary practices of people from Greece and Southern Italy circa 1960. The dietary traditions of the people in this region were first looked at because they had a very low incidence of chronic disease and high life expectancy within their population. Experts believe that the secret to this diet is its lack of modernization or refinement of food. The people in the Mediterranean region circa 1960 ate an abundant supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, and grains and seeds. The Mediterranean diet also focused on limitations of red meat, fats, added sugar, and processed foods. The pyramid further contains olive oil as the primary fat source, and focuses on fresh seafood for protein sources about two times a week instead of red meat. In addition to consuming fresh, local foods on a daily basis, the Mediterranean people also valued regular physical activity that helped to keep them fit and strong (Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, 2015).
The Asian dietary pyramid, like the Mediterranean pyramid, was first researched because of the population’s low incidence of chronic disease. The Asian dietary pyramid was developed in 1995 and covered populations from a broad range of countries in Asia including: China, India, Japan, and Thailand. One of the most prominent foods in the Asian diet is rice. Rice has an important status in many Asian countries because it has been so vital to their population’s survival during times of great famine. In addition to rice, the Asian diet also focuses on a plant based diet including vegetables, fruits, legumes, and vegetable oil. Certain coastal Asian countries such as Japan also include an abundance of fish and seafood in their diet (Asian Diet Pyramid, 2015).
The Latin American diet pyramid was developed in 1996 and was designed to guide people in consuming the traditional Latin American diet. These dietary guidelines can be dated back to representing the cultures of The Maya, Inca, and Aztec. The Latin American diet relies heavily on rich flavors and spices that are traditional to and representative of their culture. Some of the distinct foods that compose the Latin American diet are corn, potatoes, peanuts, and beans (Latin American Diet Pyramid, 2015).
The African Heritage diet pyramid is a compilation of dietary recommendations based on the dietary patterns of African people with roots in Africa, America, the Caribbean, and South America. Similar to the Latin American diet, the African diet relies heavily on rich flavor, spices, and tangy sauces to add pizzazz to simple and healthy plant based meals. The African diet focuses greatly on varieties of fresh fruits, leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, sweet potatoes, and whole grains. The African heritage pyramid also stresses the importance of consuming healthy oils, fish, poultry, and eggs. In addition to valuing healthy and nutritious foods, the African heritage lifestyle focuses on participation in uplifting activities that benefit one’s mind, body, and soul (African Heritage Diet Pyramid, 2015).

Diets of the World
United Kingdom Dietary Guidelines
The United Kingdom uses a resource called the eatwell plate. The eatwell plate is designed for “people, whether they’re a healthy weight or overweight, whether they eat meat or are vegetarian, and it applies to people of all ethnic origins” (The eatwell plate guide, 2013). The plate is designed to show different varieties of food people should eat and in what proportions they should eat them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The plate is divided into five categories: fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, dairy foods, foods and drinks high in fat and sugar, and meat, fish, eggs, beans.
The eatwell plate includes a closer look at each food group as follows:
Starchy Foods- Attempting to have at least one food that is starchy each day with your three big meals will ensure you meet your bodies carbohydrate needs. Wholegrain foods contain more fiber than white or starchy foods and thus are digested slower, keeping you full longer. Wholegrain foods include: wholegrain bread, pitta, and chapatti, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, and whole oat breakfast cereals.
Fruits and vegetables- Fruits and vegetables should take up about a third of the food eaten each day. The eatwell guide recommends eating at least five portions of different fruits and vegetables each day. A portion is 80g or any of the following: 1 apple, banana, pear, and orange, 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables, a dessert bowl of salad, or a 150 ml of fruit juice.
Milk and dairy foods- Dairy products are a good sources of protein and vitamins. While some dairy products have high levels of both fat and saturated fat, a well-balanced diet offers a wide range of other low fat choices. Lower-fat dairy options include: 1% or skimmed milk, reduced fat cheeses, or have smaller amounts of the high-fat varieties.
Non-dairy sources of protein- To meet your protein needs in a lean way, it is recommended you eat more than two servings of fish each week, some of this fish should be oily fish containing omega-3. Some meats contain high levels of fat, so when purchasing them be aware of the meet cut. The way in which meat is cooked can also effect the amount of fat and saturated fat. The following are methods to lower your fat intake; purchase meats that are lean, remove the skin on chicken breast and cut the excess fat off red meats, make sure you are grilling meat and fish more often than you are frying it, and choose to make your egg in a healthy way such as poach or boiled.  Another good altnernaive to meat is beans, peas, and lentils. These foods are high in fiber, protein and vitamins while remaining low in fat. (The eatwell guide, 2013)
Foods and drinks high in fat and/or sugar- It is recommended that this is your smallest group.  Some examples of foods that are high in fat are: cake, butter, cream, oil, and biscuits. Foods that contain high levels of sugar are: cake, biscuits, fizzy drinks, chocolate, and candy. Between meals, substitute fruit or whole wheat grains instead of fatty and sugary foods.
Food labels in the UK contain information about Guideline Daily Amount and/or traffic light color coding. The traffic light colors can easily be glanced at in the store and guide the consumer on the guidelines daily amount in the product. Red means high, amber means medium, and green means low in fat, saturated fats, sugars, and salt. (Food labels, 2015)
The eatwell plate should provide all the necessary nutrients the body needs and thus added supplements should not be needed (Your guide to the eatwell plate, 2013). Supplements have not been proven to have the same benefits as a well-balanced diet.
The eatwell plate guide includes the following 8 tips for eating well:
1.	Choose a starch as the base for your meal
2.	The majority of what you eat should be fruits and vegetables
3.	Eat two portions of fish a week- one being and oily fish
4.	Eat only a small amount of fats and sugars
5.	Try to reduce salt intake
6.	Exercise daily
7.	Drink lots of water
8.	Always eat a healthy breakfast

The Cuban Diet
When thinking of the Caribbean, most people instinctively look to the largest of the Caribbean islands, Cuba, as a reference point.  In areas such as Florida, where there is a high Cuban population, it is important to know what the dietary intake recommendations are for these large populations.  The Global Hunger Index of Cuba is >5, indicating the country’s hunger status as low to moderately severe (WHO, 2015).  The 2014 Global Nutrition Report for Cuba states that in 2008, 53% of the island’s adult population was overweight and 21% was obese (International Food Policy Research Institute, 2014, p. 1).  According to the Fall 2009 MEDICC Review, the dietary guidelines for Cubans are as follows:
Macronutrients
Protein: According to the dietary guidelines, the total intake of protein as an energy source should constitute about 10% of the total energy intake in children less than a year old and no more than 12% for all other ages (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).  It is recommended that 70% of protein consumed should be of animal origin for children under one year and 50% in all other ages (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).
Fats:  The minimum recommendation of fat intake is about 15% of the total energy intake for the Cuban diet (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).  However, as age increases, the percentage of fat intake as an energy source decreases.  Infants are recommended to have a 40% intake, 35% for children aged 6 months to 2 years, for 2–5 years, pregnant or lactating women, and those who are very physically active they are recommended to intake about 25%, for ages 7–13 about 23% is recommended, and all other ages are recommended about 20% (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).   Also for infants, the proportion of fatty acids in baby formula should be equivalent to that of breast milk (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).  No more than 10% of the total energy intake should be from saturated fatty acids, 15% from monosaturated fatty acids, and 7% from polysaturated fatty acids (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).  The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is recommended to be 5:1 (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).  The recommended limit to cholesterol consumption is 300 mg (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 9).
Carbohydrates:  The dietary recommendations for Cubans advise that no fewer than 130 g of carbohydrates be consumed for all ages other than >1 year; this was based on the average glucose demand of the brain (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).   Of the carbohydrate intake, three quarters of that intake should be of complex carbohydrates and the remaining quarter should be simple carbohydrates. (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).  The sugar intake should be no more than 10% of the total energy intake (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).
Fiber:  Until age 20, adequate intake of fiber is calculated as 5g a day plus the age of that person (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).   Adequate intake for adults (aged 19–50) is about 38g a day for men and 25g a day for women (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).   For those over 50 years, women are recommended to have 21g per day and men 30g per day (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).   55g a day is the tolerable upper intake for adults; for children, the tolerable upper intake level is the sum of their age plus 10g/day (Hernández-Triana, et al., 2009, p. 12).

The Asian diet.
The Asian diet focuses primarily on plant foods and grains. The main sources of grains in most Asian countries are noodles, millet, and rice. A plethora of different vegetables are incorporated into the Asian diet as well. Some of the most prevalent vegetables are kelp, water chestnuts, straw mushrooms, sugar peas, bamboo, baby corn, amaranth, chayote, bok choy, and mung bean sprouts. Fruits, which are often found alongside Asian dishes, include mandarin orange, melons, persimmon, lychee, kumquat, carambola, and guava. Red meat is much more sparingly used in most Asian countries. Instead, most protein is derived from plant-based foods such as soybeans (tofu and soy milk). Seafood such as squid, fish, and shellfish is also preferable. Poultry, duck eggs, pork, peanuts, and cashews also have a presence on the Asian plate. Interestingly, milk and milk products are often totally excluded from Asian diets (Rolfes & Whitney, 2015).
Asian food pyramid.
An example of an international dietary guideline is the Asian food pyramid published by the International Conference on the Diets of Asia in San Francisco in 1995. The diets of the populations of Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Philippines, South Korea, Nepal, Myanmar, Mongolia, Malaysia, Laos, Japan, Indonesia, India, China, Cambodia, and Bangladesh are included. The Asian diet has proven to produce less chronic diseases in its populations much like the diet of the Mediterranean. Asian diets closely coincide with religious practices and cultural traditions. Rice is one common and significant denominator of most Asian diets. There is a high consumption of plant foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans, legumes, nuts, and vegetable oils. Much less dairy is integrated, but some countries use some. India, for example, has paneer, ghee, and lassi as a source of dairy. Fish and other seafood are common in island nations such as Japan (“Asian Diet Pyramid,” 2015).
The Mediterranean diet.
The grains of the Mediterranean include Italian bread, bulgur, focaccia, polenta, couscous, rice, pastas, and pita pocket bread. Often accompanying these grains are vegetables such as eggplant, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and grape leaves. Fruits of the Mediterranean diet include the olive, figs, and grapes. Because most of the Mediterranean countries have access to the ocean, seafood is common. Gyros, lamb, pork, chicken, beef, sausage, lentils, and fava beans also make it to the plate in the Mediterranean. Diary is plentiful and diverse in this region’s diet. These include yogurt, goat cheese, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella, ricotta, and feta (Rolfes & Whitney, 2015).
The Mexican diet.
Taco shells, rice, and tortillas (corn and flour) are just a few of the grains often present in the Mexican diet. Chilies, tomatoes, cassava, cactus, yams, jicama, corn, chayote, and salsa are vegetables often seen in Mexican dishes. A multitude of fruits like oranges, avocadoes, papaya, mango, guava, plantain, and bananas are incorporated as well. Eggs, chorizo, beef, chicken, fish, and refried beans provide the necessary protein. Lastly, dairy includes various cheeses and custards (Rolfes & Whitney, 2015).
WHO Involvement in International Diets
WHO has set a goal to lessen chronic diseases around the world by teaching to populations about the importance of healthy eating and leading an active lifestyle. WHO’s general recommendations to all countries includes many points regarding what makes a healthy diet. Firstly, people should achieve a healthy weight and energy balance. Energy intake from shift fats and total fats should be limited. Unsaturated fats should be more regularly consumed than saturated fats. Trans-fatty acids should be eliminated according to the World Health Organization. They recommend increasing intake of whole grains, nuts, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. WHO has stated that the intake of free sugars should also be limited. Additionally, salt (sodium) should be iodized (WHO, 2015).

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
MyPlate
Dietary Planning
Section 2.4 MyPlate
[
]
"U. S. Department of Agriculture"
In 2011, the USDA introduced an educational and visual tool to represent the five food groups called MyPlate. According to “A Brief History of Food Guides” (2011), MyPlate was established along with the updating of the USDA food patterns for the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the USDA created this different shape to grab consumer’s attention with a new symbol. The MyPlate icon is a plate divided into four food groups: fruits, grains, vegetables, and protein. Another food group is indicate by the circle next to the plate which is the dairy group. Each food group is different in size which corresponds to the proportion each group contributes to a nutritious diet. MyPlate originated from the MyPyramid Food Guidance System; even though the visual diagram changed, it’s still used to help people create a balanced and healthy diet.
The MyPlate website (www.choosemyplate.gov) offers a plethora of information about healthy living. Any person who wants to create a healthy diet can find what foods and how much of that food they should eat each day based on their height, weight, gender etc. They offer information about physical activity, like why it’s important and how much activity one should do. The website also contains weight management and calorie intake tips. There’s information available for everyone including children, college students, pregnant woman, health professionals, and even older adults.
It has been shown that consumers are not actually following the recommendations set forth by MyPlate. Consumers are eating too many foods with solid fats and added sugars, whereas they should be consuming the most nutrient-dense items from the food groups. Consumers are also not eating the suggested amount from each group, usually eating not enough fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products.
One criticism of MyPlate is that it doesn’t give enough information to consumers to help them pick a healthy meal plan. All of the key information is on its website, but this won’t help someone who doesn't have internet access or know how to use the website. Another criticism is that MyPlate doesn’t distinguish some foods in the same food group as healthier than others. Also, in MyPlate’s fruit category, servings can be inputted as either food or juice. But, according to Dr. Andrew Weil, founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, MyPlate “ignores the fact that the glycemic load- an indication of how quickly a food is converted to blood sugar - is far higher in fruit juices than in fruits.”

2.4.1 Fruit Guidelines
[
]
According to the USDA MyPlate illustration, fruit is a contributor to a well-balanced and healthy diet. The daily consumption recommendation for individuals can be influenced by sex, age, and amount of physical activity. (1) MyPlate’s fruit recommendations are measured in cups. The general daily range for individuals is between 1-2 cups of fruit. One might ask, what is considered a cup of fruit? A cup of fruit can be one cup of fresh, frozen, diced, or canned fruit, a cup of 100% fruit juice, or even a half cup of dried fruit. (1) Choosing whole or diced fruit rather than fruit juices is often recommended because of the dietary fiber that whole fruits contain. (2)
There are a variety of choices that fall into the fruit category on MyPlate. Some of these choices include strawberries, bananas, oranges, blueberries, pears, grapefruit, nectarines, and watermelon. (2) The consumption of fruit is important for the human body in the aspect that fruit contains numerous nutrient and health benefits. Fruits naturally are low in nutrients that can cause weight increase, high caloric intake, or atrial blockage. The nutrients that are found to be low in fruits include fat, sodium, calories, and cholesterol. (3) Fruits can provide the body with essential nutrients that help fight disease, promote growth, and uphold the important roles of the human body.
As mentioned previously, whole or diced fruits contain dietary fibers. The fiber consumed from fruits can reduce chances of heart disease, help maintain a stable blood pressure, promote healthy digestion, and function as a vital factor in maintaining a healthy diet and body. (3) Another essential nutrient that provides the body with healthy blood pressure levels is potassium. Fruits such as bananas, cantaloupe, and dried apricots are rich in potassium. (2,3) Vitamin C is another nutrient that can be found in fruits. Citrus fruit consumption increases the amount of vitamin C in the body. The roles of vitamin C include growth, healing of wounds, and healthy teeth. (3) Another nutrient that is rich throughout fruits is folate, or folic acid. It is extremely important for women of childbearing age to meet their daily recommended intake levels of folate. Folic acid is necessary in order to minimize the risk of birth defects in a child. (3) The incorporation of fruit in the MyPlate diet can limit the chances of an individual encountering a stroke, chronic disease, or heart attack. (3) Overall, fruit is an essential part of the human diet as it provides the body with rich nutrients, proper function, and a reduced risk of disease. Consuming the recommended proportions daily will allow an individual to live a healthier lifestyle.

Which foods fall into the fruit category?
The MyPlate fruit category includes any fruit or 100% fruit juices. Fruits can come in many forms. You may find them in frozen, dried, canned, chopped, blended or whole form. You can get a portion of your daily intake of fruit in the form of applesauce, prunes, smoothies, fruit cups, or just a slice of fresh watermelon.

The amount of fruit you should consume for a healthy diet depends on an array of factors. These factors include age, physical lifestyle, daily activities, and sex. Depending on your specific circumstances, you may need to consume more or fewer fruits. Daily recommendations for fruit range between 1-2 cups with higher portions suggested for males overall. These recommendations are in place specifically for those who get fewer than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity in addition to their daily routines. As activity levels go up, the amount of fruit needed in a person’s diet increases. For example, an athlete that participates in rigorous physical activity will require more nourishment from fruit to fuel his or her energy expenditure. On the other hand, someone who works behind a desk and leads a sedentary lifestyle will require a smaller intake of fruits in their diet, as to not give the body more than it needs.
How do I measure my fruit intake?
The amount of fruit that goes into your diet is recommended in an increment of cups. This seems very straightforward; however not all fruits are easily measured in a measuring cup. For example, a cup of 100% fruit juice will constitute one cup of fruit whereas just one half of dried fruits will constitute the same amount of dietary fruit intake.
What kinds of nutrients are in fruit? What benefits does eating fruit provide?
Fruits contain a wide variety of vitamins and minerals with the potential to add structure to the body, fight off infection, and regulate bodily processes. Some of these nutrients are essential to life and include vitamin C, potassium, folate, and fiber.
Fiber:
Fiber is important in keeping the gut strong and healthy. Without it, we could experience constipation and indigestion. It also has the potential to lower blood cholesterol and put us at a lower risk for cardiovascular disease. Fiber also slows down our digestion and leaves us feeling fuller for longer. This key factor can alleviate over eating and weight gain. The most fibrous part of the fruit is generally in the fruit itself, not the juice. So if you are looking to boost your fiber intake, choose whole fruits or juices that are high in pulp.
Folate:
Folate (folic acid) is a key vitamin that participates in the formation of red blood cells. Because of its participation in DNA synthesis, it is extremely important in fetal development. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate. This supplement should be taken by women of childbearing age in increments of 400 mcg/day (especially those who are pregnant) in addition to a normal dietary intake of folate. This supplementation will reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida along with anencephaly during the development of the fetus. For this reason, a mandate has been put into effect for many of our foods to be fortified with folic acid as well.
Vitamin C:
Vitamin C is an important nutrient in maintaining healthy structures within the body. It works alongside collagen in creating, maintaining, and healing body tissues. Vitamin C also helps keep our gums and teeth in good condition.
Potassium:
Potassium is a big player in regulating our blood pressure. For people with high blood pressure, an increase in potassium intake can increase potassium levels in the blood and work to combat cardiovascular stress. Potassium also has the power to reduce risk of kidney stones and help prevent bone loss. We can find potassium in bananas, cantaloupe, prunes, peaches, apricots, and honeydew.

2.4.2 Vegetable Guidelines
[
]
Arguably vegetables are one of the most important food groups because vegetarians utilize this group to substitute many of the other options on the plate in order to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Vegetables are broken down into five different subgroups including dark-green vegetables, starchy vegetables, beans and peas, red and orange vegetables and other vegetables. (choosemyplate.gov) The amount of vegetables per day that a person needs to consume depends on age, gender and physical activity level. In general, the amount of vegetables a person needs to consume daily is anywhere from two to three cups of vegetables. (choosemyplate.gov) Vegetables can be prepared in a variety of different ways including frozen, raw, fresh, cooked, canned, dried/dehydrated, canned, whole, cut up or mashed. The best way to eat them is by not adding anything when preparing them in order to limit the amount of added calories from sodium or sugar. Although many people assume eating healthy is expensive, buying many vegetables when they are in season and freezing them can save money. If fresh vegetables are still too expensive, purchase canned vegetables that are “low sodium,” “reduced sodium,” or “no salt added,” in order to ensure less consumption of sodium. There are many different companies making eating vegetables even easier because of the variety of frozen foods available in the frozen section in the grocery store. Many of them just need to be taken out of the freezer and popped in the microwave for a few minutes.
       The hardest part about meeting the vegetable requirement is attempting to eat some vegetables from within each subgroup in order to have a variety of nutrients in your diet. Below is a table with five different vegetables from each of the five subgroups. Each subgroup can other a variety of benefits. The dark-green vegetables are rich in fiber, folate, carotenoids, vitamins C and K, iron and calcium. (Adams) They can offer many health benefits such as as reducing the risk for many different cancers in the body. (Adams) The starchy vegetables are also rich in fiber but contain vitamin B-6 as well. (healthyeating.sfgate.com) The beans and peas group are a little more unique because they are also a plant based protein and vegetarians are able to meet their protein requirement through eating them. Along with their excellent source of protein, they are rich in fiber, potassium and folate. (choosemyplate.gov) As you can see there is some overlap between the red and orange vegetables and the starchy vegetables. The red and orange vegetables offer potassium, vitamin A, C and K. (foodandhealth.com) These vegetables are the biggest aid in protecting the heart and reducing the risk of heart disease. (foodandhealth.com)

2.4.3 Grain Guidelines
[
]
A grain is classified as any food made from wheat, oats, rice, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain. Grains can be broken down into two groups, whole grains and refined grains. The difference between these two classifications of grains lies in how much of the grain kernel each contains. While whole grains contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ, and the endosperm, refined grains have been milled, removing the bran and the germ. This milling process takes place in order to improve the texture and shelf life of grains. However, important nutrients such as dietary fiber, iron, and several B vitamins are removed in the process. Examples of whole grains include quinoa, oats, and brown rice (wholegrainscouncil.org, 2013). Examples of refined grains include white rice, white bread, and white pasta (dese.mo.gov, 2015).
In regards to the amount of grain that should be consumed daily, the number varies depending on a person’s age, gender, and level of physical activity. In general for all age ranges and genders a person should consume between three and eight ounce equivalents of grain each day (choosemyplate.gov, 2015). It is important to note, however that these amounts are only applicable to those who get less than thirty minutes of physical activity per day. For those who are more active than this, a higher amount of grains can be consumed without exceeding his or her recommended calorie intake. Another rule of thumb to live by in finding how much grain to consume is that at least half of the total grains consumed by a person should be whole grains.
In understanding that he or she should consume a certain number of ounce equivalents of grain each day, one may wonder what counts as an ounce equivalent of grain? How can this be measured?  The chart below summarizes these equivalences. Note that all of these are whole grains (choosemyplate.gov, 2015).
Food Type
1 ounce Equivalent
Bagels
1" mini bagel
Biscuits
1 small (2" diameter)
Bulgur
1/2 cup cooked
Cornbread
1 small piece
Crackers
5 whole wheat crackers
English Muffins
1/2 muffin
Muffins
1 small
Oatmeal
1/2 cup cooked
Pancakes
1 pancake (4 1/2" diameter)
Popcorn
3 cups, popped
Pasta
1/2 cup cooked
Rice
1/2 cup cooked
Tortillas
1 large tortilla (12" diameter)
Breads
1 Regular slice; 1 small slice French; 4 snack-size slices rye bread
The benefits of eating whole grains are plentiful. Unlike refined grains, whole grains provide essential vitamins and minerals such as fiber, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, folate, iron, magnesium, and selenium. The presence of these nutrients in the body has numerous benefits, including gut health, energy, proper red blood cell formation, oxygen transport in the blood, antioxidants. In a more general sense, eating whole grains serves to reduce the risk of heart disease, aid in metabolism and weight management, and reduce the risk of complications in pregnancy. In this way, whole grains are an essential part of the human diet, and should be consumed in the proper proportions daily.

2.4.4 Protein Guidelines
[
]
Proteins foods include meat, poultry, seafood, beans, peas, eggs, nuts, seeds, and processed soy products. Eating a variety of protein products is necessary for maintaining health and proper nutrient intake. It is even suggested that adults eat at least 8 ounces of seafood a week!1 However, people who practice vegetarianism or veganism have to option of filling their plate with beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy products to consume an adequate amount of protein.
Protein foods often include nutrients such as B vitamin, iron, zinc, and magnesium. Protein’s main function in the body is aid in the synthesis of bones, muscles, skin, blood, enzymes, hormones, amino acids, and vitamins.1,2 B vitamins help the body make nutrients, build tissues, form red blood cells, and release energy. Iron is necessary to carry oxygen to the blood.1 Zinc helps the immune system function and is needed for biochemical reactions.1 The body uses magnesium to build bones and release energy from muscles. Seafood is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids which is an essential fatty acid.1 Thus, it is important to incorporate protein in your diet to make sure your body runs efficiently.1

   The amount of protein that a person needs depends on factors such as age, sex, and level of physical activity.2 In general, though, people between the ages of 19–30 years old need more protein than older and younger people, men need more protein than women, and people who are more physically active need to consume more protein.1 For example, women aged 31–35 need 5 ounce equivalents to maintain a proper diet. One ounce of protein is equivalent to 1 ounce of meat, poultry, or fish, ¼ cup of beans (cooked), one egg, 1 tbs. of peanut better, or ½ oz. of nuts or seeds according to My Plate.1
Although the average American gets enough protein in their diet, it is also important that their meat and poultry are low-fat or lean because too much saturated fat and cholesterol is bad for your health. If, for instance, a person chooses to eat chicken with skin, the extra fat they are consuming by eating the skin counts against their limit for calories from saturated fats. Even a well-trimmed steak can contain a lot of “bad” cholesterol, called low density lipoprotein (LDL) and lean ground beef can still be high in saturated fats.1 Cholesterol is only found in foods that come from animals so instead of having both a steak for lunch and a burger for dinner, beans and lentils could substitute one of the meats at a meal. Substituting healthy proteins in for red meat can lower a person’s risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis.3 Getting adequate amounts of healthy proteins have also been linked to a healthy weight!3
Further, processed meats, like deli meats, and also some packaged seeds and nuts have added sodium that should be considered.1 Eating unsalted nuts and seeds in moderation, though, may reduce a person’s risk of heart disease. Nuts and seeds are high in calories and should be used to replace, not in conjunction with, other proteins such as meat at meals.
Another important factor is that a person chooses seafood that is high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon. Eating 8 ounces of a variety of seafood a week helps lower an adult’s risk for heart disease.1 While some people may be concerned about the level of mercury in seafood My Plate assures people that the health benefits of fish outweigh the mercury risk.1 Further, salmon, trout, sardines, and anchovies are all seafood options that are low in mercury.1
Because excess protein cannot be stored in the body, it is important to consume an adequate amount of protein daily from a variety of food sources.2 On the other hand, a deficiency in protein can even lead to kwashiokor.2

2.4.5 Dairy Guidelines
[
]
When you think about dairy, you may be taken back to last summer eating fluffy scoops of strawberry ice cream or your routine breakfast with a glass of ice-cold milk. Maybe for some of us, we cringe at the thought of getting an upset stomach. The unique nature of the human body allows us to choose what foods we enjoy but at the same time, prevents us from eating certain foods. With the variability in each individual, how do we make sure nutritional needs are met for MyPlate’s dairy guidelines?
MyPlate Dairy Recommendations:
The recommended amount of daily dairy serving is about 3 cups for adults and 2-2 1/5 cups for children 8 years and younger. (
http://www.choosemyplate.gov/dairy
)
•	1 cup of milk, yogurt, or soy beverage
•	1 ½ ounces of natural cheese
•	2 ounces of processed cheese
Sources of calcium in non-dairy products:
•	Calcium-fortified juices, cereals, breads, nuts and seeds, rice milk or almond milk
•	Canned fish, soybeans and soy products, other beans and some leafy greens like collard and turnip greens, kale, and bok choy
Lactose Intolerance:
•	Lactose intolerance is the inability to consume lactose, a sugar found in milk, because the body cannot create enough of the enzyme lactase to break it down
•	People who have lactose intolerance should drink lactose-free milk and lactose-free products
Health Benefits and Nutrients:
Why is dairy important in our diets? Dairy provides important nutrients that help maintain and build your body: calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein. (
http://www.choosemyplate.gov/dairy-nutrients-health
) Calcium builds bones and teeth therefore diets fulfilling the 3 cup requirement can improve bone mass. Dairy products and fresh foods provide potassium. Potassium supports healthy blood pressure because it reduces high levels of sodium intake. Vitamin D regulates levels of calcium and phosphorus. Milk and soymilk are good sources of Vitamin D.
	Improved bone health reduces the risk of osteoporosis. Children and adolescents need adequate amounts of these nutrients because bone mass is being built. Consuming enough dairy is associated with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and type two diabetes.
Compare Calcium rich foods: (
http://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/calcium_content_of_selected_foods/
)
•	1 cup of milk or 8 oz. of calcium fortified orange juice= 300 mg
•	3 oz. of canned salmon= 170–210 mg
•	1 cup of cooked spinach= 240 mg
Saturated Fat in Dairy:
You might be concerned that some dairy products are high in fat. MyPlate recommends choosing fat-free or low-fat options. This is because many milks and cheeses are high in saturated fats. These fats can raise your LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) levels. Excess LDL cholesterol collects in the walls of your blood vessels, increasing your risk for heart disease. In turn, HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol helps remove LDL cholesterol by recycling it back into the liver where it can be broken down.

Eating Dairy can be Easier!:
Low-fat or fat-free dairy products can be used as a substitute in various recipes. Whether you are trying to include more dairy in your diet or you need help getting your child to eat more, here are some tips:
•	Use yogurt as a base for vegetable and fruit dips
•	Include yogurt or milk into smoothies
•	Use yogurt as a substitute for sour cream
•	Include milk or calcium-fortified soymilk (soy beverage) as a beverage at meals. Choose fat-free or low-fat milk
•	Lightly top meals with low-fat cheeses
•	Add low-fat or skim milk to coffee instead of heavy creams
•	Top yogurt with fruit, granola or dark chocolate for a light dessert

2.4.6 Empty Calories
[
]
Empty calories: What are they?
Empty Calories are found commonly throughout the food and drinks that Americans consume. These are calories from added sugars and solid fats, they add calories to food but have little to no nutrients. Due to the fact that they have little nutritional value, they are considered empty calories. Empty calories can come in many different foods from being processed or prepared, they most popular being things such as cakes, ice cream, and pizza. In certain cases, such as soda and candy, all the calories are empty calories and contain no nutrients that we may need. Added sugars and solid fats make food look more appealing but add a lot of calories even when a small amount is consumed. You are able to find foods high in solid fats and added sugars in forms with less solid fats and sugars or none at all such as low-fat cheese, or choosing sugar-free sodas. But it is important to know that “empty calories from solid fats and added sugars can be found in some other foods that contain important nutrients.” (choosemyplate.org)
What are solid fats?
When talking about solid fats and added sugars and avoiding them, it is viable to know what exactly they are. “Solid fats are fats that are solid at room temperature, like beef fat, butter, and shortening.” (choosemyplate.org) For example, Land O Lakes butter is only made of cream and salt, contains 30 mg of Cholesterol, 90 mg of Sodium, and 11g of total fats, 7 of which are saturated fats (Landolakes.com). Though some food has solid fats occur naturally, they can still be added to any prepared or processed foods. Solid fats have less monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats and are high in saturated fats and/or trans fats. As well as having solid fats, animal products can contain cholesterol, and saturated fats and trans fats have a tendency to raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels in blood. This means that the more animal product you consume, you are raising the risk for heart disease. To lower this deadly risk, you can cut back on any foods that may contain trans fats and saturated fats. It is also important to note that solid fats and oils provide the same number of calories per gram but oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature. Oils are typically lower in saturated fats and trans fats making them generally better for your health.
Examples include: (choosemyplate.org)
•	milk fat
•	butter
•	chicken fat
•	cream
•	stick margarine
•	shortening
•	lard
•	pork fat
What is considered added sugar and what is it?
Added sugars are any syrups or sugars added to the food or drinks while they are processed or prepared. Added sugars does not include the naturally occurring sugars in things such as fruit and milk. As for added sugars, it is important to be aware of the many different names that added sugars may have, the most common being fructose, dextrose, maltose, and sucrose. Be aware that you will see many other names for added sugars but they are not recognized by the FDA as an ingredient name such as can juice, fruit juice concentrate, crystal dextrose, liquid fructose, and fruit nectar. An example of a food that is mainly added sugars is a normal 12oz can of Coca-Cola, containing carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric aced, natural flavors, and caffeine (coca-colaproductfacts.com) all while having no real nutritional value that we need. Another example is an original milky way that contains sugars such as milk fat, corn syrup, lactose, sugar, and palm kernel oil (milkywaybar.com) that also contains no nutrients that are valuable to us.
Examples include: (choosemyplate.org)
•	candy
•	cake
•	soft drinks, energy drinks, or sports drinks
•	pies
•	sweet rolls, donuts, pastries
•	ice cream
•	fruity drinks
How many can I have?
Once you are aware of what kinds of foods and drinks contain empty calories, it is important to know how many calories your diet might allow you to have. Many factors play a role in how many empty calories you can have such as age, gender group, and how much physical activity you partake in. The more physically active you are; the more calories you are going to need to consume which gives you a larger range for empty calorie consumption
How do you count empty calories?
When figuring out how many empty calories your diet may allow, it is viable to know how to count your empty calories. For example, fats are a very concentrated source of calories so even eating a small amount might send you overboard on your empty calorie limit. As for added sugars, they are usually served in large portions such as soda, or big candy bars and they can also send you over on your empty calorie limit. To lower your empty calorie limit, you can limit your consumption of empty calories by eating smaller portions and choose foods which less added sugars and solid fats. Because you can find solid fats naturally in foods and there is typically added sugars in processed and prepared food so it is still very easy to go over your calorie limit even when making healthy choices.

Dietary Planning: USDA Food Patterns
The USDA Food Patterns were created in order to guide and inform consumers about the Dietary Guidelines recommendations.  The Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) update the Dietary Guidelines for Americans about every five years.  They provide consumers with information in order for individuals to make appropriate food choices.  It is used to help an individual maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of disease.
The USDA Food Patterns assign foods into five major food groups, which are fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy.  These groups and their subgroups suggest the amounts of food needed to consume in order to meet the recommended nutrients.  The USDA Food Patterns also show the amount oils needed and the maximum number of calories that can be consumed from fats and added sugars.
The amount of each food group needed daily varies on the person and his or her energy needs.   The USDA Food Patterns uses different calorie levels in order to provide an accurate guide for people of all ages.  The USDA Food Patterns are typically shown in a table that list the five major food groups and the different calorie levels.  The chart shows the amount of each food is needed to meet a certain calorie level.  The amount of food is usually measured in cups, ounces, and grams.
In addition, there are subgroups for the five different major food groups.  For example, the vegetable group can be broken down into subgroups: dark-green vegetables, red and orange vegetables, beans and peas, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables.  Some of the charts of USDA Food Patterns also show the amount of oils, solid fats, and added sugars needed.  There is also a calorie range chart that shows how many calories are needed for females and males of all ages.  It also gives an estimate of the individual calorie needs for people that are either sedentary or active.
Furthermore, the USDA Food Patterns also show the nutrients need for different calorie levels.  The nutrients include macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals.  The nutrient groups can be combined with the food groups in order to show the amount of nutrients can be obtain from certain subgroups.  There are many way for the USDA Food Patterns to be listed in order to educate the consumer.  The USDA Food Patterns have been made into a food pyramid, and they have also been recently been made into “MyPlate.”  This is used to communicate the Dietary Guidelines, and it is designed to illustrate the consumption of many different nutritional foods.

2.5.2 Exchange Lists
[
]
Vitamins are compounds that occur naturally in foods and are essential for several functions. They can be either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are metabolized and stored by the fat in your body. Water-soluble vitamins are not stored and must be consumed every day. Your body excretes the water-soluble vitamins it doesn't use. Eating a balanced diet, incorporating foods from all food groups, ensures you get all of the important vitamins you need.
The Exchange List system is originally and most ideal for diabetics. It guides the consumer to make food choices on the basis on different food groups based on their energy content. Those grouped together have the same content of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Therefore, a person who follows those guidelines can exchange any number of foods within that food group and receive the same nutritional content. This is especially important for those who have special dietary needs such as diabetics (Rodibaugh, n.d., p. 1).
For that reason, according to the Mayo Clinic Staff (2015), each exchange list can be used for diabetics to control their blood sugar content while maintaining a healthy diet. In fact, this can be extended towards everyone in order to live a healthy lifestyle. Diets can be prescribed or recommended by dietitians to create the optimal diet on an individual basis. One way to create a plan to maintain lower blood sugar content is through the exchange list program which houses “choices”. These choices are described within the main food groups (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2015, p. 1).
Such that is the basis of the system, Dr. Rosemary Rodibaugh (n.d.) explains in her introduction page that there are three main groups: carbohydrates, meat and substitute, and fat group. Within each group are subsections such as fruit, milk, starch, vegetables, and other carbohydrates for the carbohydrates group. The section is thus divided again into different types of food products that fall within that category. Furthermore, the subsections within the main groups contain the specific grams of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in addition to total calories. For example, within the starch list is a category such as bread. Under this category there can be specific products such as a bagel with a description of its serving, or in this case ½ serving or 1 oz. (Rodibaugh, n.d., 1-2).
Moreover, the Diabetes Education Online organization (n.d.) explains that each main food group has a certain number of grams within on exchange. For example, for carbohydrates there can be 15 grams within one exchange. Furthermore, to carry out such a plan it it is important to talk to a dietitian to obtain the proper ratio of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats while staying within the recommended calorie intake as suggested by Lyon College (n.d.). From there, the individual can choose from lists created from organizations such as American Diabetic Association and American Dietetic Association. Lists are predetermined and solely based on energy content not on traditional food groups. For example, within the starchy vegetables category there are plantains, pumpkins, and spaghetti/spaghetti sauce. These would normally be under other food groups such as fruits or grains but their content is such that they resemble other food groups such as corn or baked potatoes. Within this category includes 15 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams protein, 1 gram of fat, and 80 categories (Lyon College, n.d.).

2.5.3 Food Labels
[
]
Practically all packaged foods have food labels which provide information about ingredients, serving sizes, the amounts of nutrients, and Daily Values.  Restaurants are also providing nutritional information on their menus, including kcalories and amount of fat in a given dish. These labels are valuable sources of information for dietary planning, especially for individuals following specific diets due to health concerns or issues.
Nutrition Facts Label
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration breaks down the nutrition facts label into three parts: serving size, calories, and nutrients.  Serving sizes have been standardized among common foods to allow for easier comparison between different products. The general units include cups, ounces, or even the number of pieces. The serving size used will affect the rest of the information on the label. It is important for consumers to take note of the serving size before analyzing the rest of the nutritional information because ¼ cup of a product will certainly have fewer calories and grams of fat than ½ cup of that same product.
The next part of the nutrition facts label is the calories per serving and the calories from fat. Calories are a measure of energy and most nutritional guides are based on a 2,000 kcalorie diet. The total calories are determined based on the serving size and the calories from fat are how many of those calories come solely from fat. For example, a single serving may have a total of 250 calories but 100 of those calories may be from fat. Paying attention to the amount of calories and using it to control portions can be used in diet planning.
	Consumers can also gather information about the nutrients present in foods and the Daily Values of these nutrients.  Daily Values must be provided for kcalories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium. Fats (saturated and trans), cholesterol, and sodium should be limited in the diet to prevent the onset of obesity, heart complications, and other chronic illnesses. However, beneficial nutrients such as Vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium should be consumed in quantities that satisfy daily needs. Daily values are calculated based on age and gender by the FDA in order to find the amounts of nutrients in a single serving in relation to the required amount. The percent Daily Value can also be found on food labels and are based on a 2,000 kcalorie diet.
Ingredients
	Another valuable source of information on food labels is the ingredient list.  All ingredients, natural and additives, must be listed. The ingredients are listed in a specific order: the first ingredient is the most present in terms of weight. The list then descends in terms of the weight of the ingredient in the product. Consumers can determine the nutrient density of food products by looking at the first ingredient in the list. Is the first ingredient something nutritious like whole grain or is it sugar? The ingredient list is also useful for those individuals who have food allergies.
Front-of-Package Labels
The Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Marketing Institute has implemented a quicker way to retrieve the same information that would be found on a nutrition facts panel. Facts Up Front can be found on the front of food packages and utilize different colors and symbols. There is a standardized aesthetic that provides key facts like the amount of calories, fats, sodium, and sugars.
Claims Made by Food Labels
The various claims that consumers may encounter on the Nutrition Facts panel include nutrient claims, health claims, and structure-function claims.  These can cause confusion and mislead the consumer about the quality of the food product they are buying.
	Nutrient claims disclose the amount of a nutrient that can be found in the product. These claims must follow FDA standards before they can be made. Before saying something is “fat free”, the product must meet the FDA’s expectations of food that has low enough amounts of fat to be considered “fat free”. If nutrients have been added to a food, these must also be listed on the product.
	When food manufacturers make a correlation between food and a health condition, they are making health claims. Some of these may be based on true research and evidence. However, there are claims that have not been backed by enough evidence to be considered proven. Precise language must be used when supporting these claims.
	The last type of claim is structure-function claims which do not require FDA approval but imply a relationship exists between a nutrient and a function in the body. These do not require proof so long as these claims do not specifically name a disease or illness. They can appear similar to health claims but structure-function claims do not require the FDA’s approval.
The first items on the nutrition facts label that a consumer should look at are the serving size and the number of servings in the package. The serving size helps the consumer to compare items, and it influences the amount of all the nutrients listed on the label. The next item on the nutrition facts label that a consumer should look at is the calories. The number of calories is indicative of how much energy the individual gets from the food product. Americans have a tendency to consume more calories than necessary, so it is very important to understand how many calories are in the food that is being purchased and eaten. Americans also tend to consume an excess of fat, cholesterol, and sodium, which are listed at the top of the nutrition label. The amount of these nutrients that are consumed need to be limited. When a consumer is comparing foods, it is best to look for lower amounts of these nutrients. Other nutrients, such as fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron, can improve your health. It is important that adequate amounts of these nutrients are consumed to prevent certain health conditions.
The Food and Drug Administration requires authorization for health claims on nutrition labels. The administration reviews petitions for health claims and the evidence supporting these health claims must be found credible in order for the petition to be approved. The health claim must contain both a substance and a health condition. This process prevents consumers from receiving incorrect information on their food labels. Nutrient content claims describe the amount of nutrients in a specific product, and compare the level of nutrients between products. Terms such as free, high, low, more, reduced and lite are used to make these claims. In order for a product to be labeled fat free, it must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat in each serving. A low fat product must contain less than 3 grams in each serving and a reduced fat product must have 25% less fat than the original product. High fat products have more than 13 grams per serving and the label must instruct the consumer to look at the nutrition facts for fat content. There are also specific label claim guidelines for calorie, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar content. These guidelines are important to follow, so the consumer understands the nutritional content of the product and how it can impact their health. However, these claims can also be misleading. For example, if the consumer believes they are purchasing a fat free product, but it has 0.5 grams of fat, they do not have an accurate idea of the nutritional content of the food they are eating.

A large part in dietary planning involves being able to accurately read and interpret food labels, more specifically nutrition fact panels and label claims. The basics to learning how to read a nutrition facts panel starts with the serving size. You can find this at the top of the panel. Always compare portion size of your actual meal to the serving size. This allows for an accurate portrayal of how many calories and fat you are actually eating. (EatRight, 2015) Next, checking out the total calories and fat is essential to dietary planning, especially when watching weight. Total calories and calories from fat should be the focus. To help get a better understanding of how the food you are eating fits comparably to your entire daily meal plan, use percent Daily Values. The Daily Value is a model for nutrients in one serving of food based on a 2,000-calorie diet. (Mayo Clinic, 2015) For example, if your food has 18% total fat Daily Value percentage, then that one serving of your food has 18% of the fat content you are recommended for the day. Using this as your guide for nutrient and macronutrient content is a great asset to dietary planning. Having a low DV of 5% or lower should typically be reserved for total fat, trans fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. Implementing these restrictions allows for a decreased risk of chronic disease and hypertension. Having a DV percentage of 20% or higher should be aimed towards vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Doing this will help to maintain good health and also decrease risk of disease and hypertension. Additionally, the DV of protein is not required to be on the label because most Americans eat protein in excess. Aiming for lean protein such as poultry, fish, and eggs is recommended. Lastly, limiting added sugars is pertinent to dietary planning. Added sugars will be listed in ingredients. Beware of added sugars coming from refined sources including table sugar or corn syrup. Ingredient lists are required if the foods have more than one ingredient and are listed in order from most weight to least. (FDA, 2015)

2.5.4 Using Your Plan
[
]
Everyday, multiple times a day, you make food choices on what to eat and what not to eat. Most people on average eat what ever is in front of them with out giving much thought to the contributing nutrients, health benefits or health consequences of the chosen foods. In this section, we will discuss on reasons why it is beneficial to create a healthy meal plan and how to efficiently and effectively put a healthy meal plan to use.
People can use meal plans to lose weight, maintain weight or just make sure they are staying healthy by getting the proper daily recommendations of the food groups. Following a meal plan allows one to follow an eating pattern that ensures they are getting the proper daily recommendations and also allows them to make smart nutrition decisions based on their health goal. Setting up a meal plan allows one to lose weight by making sure there is a healthy deficit in calories per week. In trying to lose weight, one must make sure they are still getting healthy proportions of their food groups based on the USDA and what their activity level is like. If you are active, you must make sure you are getting the proper nutrients to support your body’s work out activities. Loosing weight too quickly is detrimental to health and is recommended to 1 lb per week. One could set up a meal plan to maintain weight by making sure they are staying in the range of their food recommendations. Also, using a meal plan is beneficial for ones health by getting the correct amount of daily recommendations of food. Having too much or too little of a nutrient can result in health problems and diseases. Eating the proper amount of foods decreases the risk of creating health issues.
Creating meal plans easily guides people of what foods to eat that will deliver the acceptable amount of nutrients that the body needs without much thought process. First, one must know information of the food groups in order to efficiently and effectively put your meal plan to use. Based on the knowledge of knowing what foods you should be eating, you should also know the proportions of foods you need in each food group based on your activity level, age and sex. Each food group delivers key nutrients that are necessary for the body’s needs. Once you know the amounts of food you need to consume per food group, you can decide which foods you would like to eat. You can base you diet on a 3-meal per day plan of breakfast, lunch, and dinner with bigger portions or choose to make a 6-meal per day plan of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with snack times in between, but with smaller portions. Whichever you prefer, you must make sure you are totaling to the daily amount of food from each food group recommended. Some people get bored of eating the same foods everyday and it is also important to make sure you have variety and moderation in your diet. What is recommended is making a different meal plan for each day of the week and then switching your day plans for the following weeks. Putting your plan to use allows you to make smart decisions on what you are eating in order to stay healthy.

2.6 Dietary Assessment
[

Dietary Assessment
In a society that is constantly performing in a type A lifestyle, it is sometimes quite difficult for person to find time for their bodies. Now I’m not just talking about exercising, people actually forget to monitor something that is equal to if not more important; their diets. Fortunately, there is a test a person can use in order to monitor their diets, and it’s a Dietary assessment. According to Delores Truesdell from the American Heart association, a dietary assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of a person’s food consumption. In order words, it is the gathering of information of all the foods and beverages a person intakes. It is also a segmented section of a full nutritional assessment done in a clinical setting, sort of like a physical, but specifically for the diet.  Moreover, a dietary assessment is accompanied by three other evaluations including, anthropometrics, which measures a person’s weight to height ratio and body mass index, a physical examination, and a biochemical exam. What is even more promising, is how vital a dietary assessment can be for a person’s future and current health. Especially since it may uncover possible risks like chronic diseases and assist with the prevention of theses diseases.  Once the data is collected from the person, it is used to calculate the percentages of energy, nutrients, and what the category each food consumed falls in to. In a typical examination a few things need to happen before receiving important results. Starting off with a 24-hour recall, which according to UCLA’s School of medicine, a patient is asked to recall all of the foods and beverages they consumed in the last 24 hours. Then the patient is asked to recall a typical daily intake pattern, including the methods and frequency preparation in their foods. The Food Frequency questionnaire is then used to make a standardized checklist where the patient can check off the specific foods they consumed. Finally, a Dietary food log would be incorporated in order to ask the patient to record all the foods consumed for one week, and that is the information that will later be entered into a program that will calculate and analyze the data obtained.  From that data usually consisting of consumed calories, fats, proteins and carbs, the Nutritionist would make decisions or suggestions on important changes that need to be made in order to help the patient live a healthier lifestyle. Think about a situation where a dietary assessment did not exist. What would happen to our society? It seems like we would all be walking health issues. The reality of it is even with these specific assessments out there, and all the progress we have made in order to become a healthier society, we still have many people that suffer from dietary health issues. Fortunately, we as a society are continuing to shed light on the harmful risks of unhealthy consumption and find solutions to this problem.

2.6.1 Individual Assessment
[
]
Patient History
[
]
There are many factors to include in a patient’s history such as food preferences, health risk, and food intake.  Food preferences as a result of cultural, religious, and ethnic reasons influence a patient’s history (Fine). Health risk is an additional component to a patient’s history. Family history, disease, and risk factors for diseases are all analyzed as part of a patient’s health risk. For example, a body mass index (BMI) over 30 is considered obese and is a risk factor for diabetes (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). Health risk factors can usually be evaluated using physical and laboratory measurements. Food intake, including nutritional supplements, is another factor to include in a patient’s history. If a patient is taking vitamins or minerals as supplementation, is important to record the dosage, frequency, and dosage of the particular supplement (Thompson & Byers, 1994, p. 2259S) Environmental factors such as poverty and illiteracy can coincide with some nutritional deficiencies (“Clinical assessment,” 1973).

Physical Measurements
[
]
Dental evaluations can be a crucial part for a nutritional assessment. Dental caries, edema, bleeding, calculus deposits, and soft materia alba are all considerations that should be included in in a dental report (“Clinical assessment,” 1973). Physical signs of malnutrition can be found all over the body. General appearance, hair, skin, skeletal, muscle, eyes, face, mouth, teeth, mouth, and organs should all be included in an evaluation for malnutrition (“Clinical assessment,” 1973). In a 1968 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health, recommendations were made for clinical evaluation of nutrition. For infants, weight, recumbent length, head circumference, chest circumference, and triceps skinfold are recommended measurements. Pre-schooler age children should be measured for all of those previously listed, with recumbent height replaced with standing height and the addition of arm circumference. School age through adolescents should be measured the same, besides head and chest circumferences. Lastly, adults should be nutritionally evaluated with standing height, weight, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, and arm circumference. Symptoms for a nutrient deficiency present differently on different populations depending on multiple factors. For example, deficiency of vitamin C, or scurvy, presents as swollen joints in children, but as black and blue marks on elderly people’s shinbones (“Clinical assessment,” 1973).

Laboratory Measurements
[
]
When tending to an individual there are different methods that a professional could use to assess the person. These methods include:
Dietary Records
24- Hour Diet Recall
Food Frequency (Ferro-Luzzi)
Dietary Records
This method requires the individual, or other (as in the case for a parent reporting for their child), to report everything they eat. Ideally this is done as the person eats so that they are less likely to forget to report something. This method can last anywhere from one to seven days but the ideal number of days is four since subjects tend to report less and less.
(Coulston, 2001)
The individual being assessed is usually trained in how to report their diet including not only what they eat but also the amount (which can be measured with a scale or household measures), recipe, method they used to prepare their meals. If the assessment has a specific focus on a certain food group then an individual may only need to keep track of the food they consume that pertains to that group.(Chapter 3)
Pros:
Open-ended
Does not rely on memory
Cons
:
Individuals can and sometimes do alter their eating patterns and quantities consumed since they have to record everything
Validity since a person might not record what they eat as they eat but hours later when they may forget to include some details
Requires literacy, limiting who can be assessed (individuals with a lower income) (Chapter 3)
24- Hour Diet Recall
This method involves a 30 to 45 minute interview with the participant. During this time they are asked what they have consumed in the last 24 hours, or just the day before. These interviews are conducted by experienced, well-trained professionals, usually dieticians, since a lot of information is obtained from asking probing questions. Probing questions are extremely useful for getting a lot of forgotten information, such as food additives such as condiments. Also the interviewer should have extensive knowledge of food and how it is prepared.
When conducting the interview the Automated Multi-Pass Method (AMPM) is used. This involves the individual being assessed listing out a “quick list” of the foods they can remember having eaten to the interviewer. This is followed by a forgotten food list consisting of nine food categories usually left out. Next the individual must state the times that they ate the foods and are then asked probing questions. Lastly, a final review is conducted to ensure that nothing was left off. (Coulston, 2001)
Pros:
Literacy not required
Does not alter intake behavior
Cons:
Skilled, trained interviewer needed
Relies on memory
(Chapter 3)
Food frequency
This method is a questionnaire consisting of a list of food groups. Next to each category the individual is required to estimate the amount of times they consume that particular food in a given day, month, or year. Some questionnaires include questions about food preparation, supplements and brands of food that a person usually eats. (Coulston, 2001)
This method can also be used to determine whether a relationship exists between a food consumed and whether the population consuming this food contracts a certain disease. The main reason behind using this method, however, is to get an estimate of the total amount of different types of food consumed. The questionnaires can be self-administered or given by a trained professional in person or on the phone. (Ferro-Luzzi)
Pros
:
Inexpensive
Cons
:
Invalid; people may not remember how often they eat a certain food
Complex calculations required
Measurement error
(Chapter 3)
Chemical analysis of diets
Another method of analysis requires the individual to bring exact replicas of what they normally eat. They are then stored in a refrigerator before being tested. The foods can be tested in two ways: an exact replica of the foods eaten, or the raw foods that are made into the meal consumed. After being refrigerated the food is weighed and chemically analyzed. Even though it is accurate, this method is not readily used since it’s so inconvenient to use. (Ferro- Luzzi)
Pros
:
Accurate
Provides a lot of information of nutrient content of consumed foods
Cons
:
Time consuming
Costly
(Chapter 3)
Laboratory methods involving blood panels can also be used to determine deficiencies in serum protein, iron, folacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, iron, iodine, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and vitamins C, A D, E, and K. However, not all nutrient deficiencies can be measured via laboratory methods (“Laboratory assessment,” 1973).

2.6.2 Population Assessment
[
]
Population Data
[
]
Many nations and organizations around the world are working to improve human nutrition. On the national level, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) publishes Nutrition Country Profiles in developing countries assessing the nutrition status of populations (FAO, 2010). On the national level, companies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also monitor the nutrition status of populations (CDC, 2014). These organizations use several methods to collect data about populations studied. These include conducting national surveys, reviewing historical information, and conducting laboratory tests and physical examinations.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is the basis for the national standards for health assessment in the United States. It is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the CDC. The NHANES consists of a series of surveys and examinations that obtain data from 5,000 individuals per year. This survey is used to determine the prevalence and risk factors for many conditions such as diabetes, metabolic diseases, obesity, diabetes, eye diseases, oral health, osteoporosis, and respiratory disease. It also measures physical fitness, physical functioning and nutrition in general to educate both health professionals and American citizens alike (CDC, 2014). It is important to note that the survey method requires that individuals self-report their health status, therefore the prevalence reported may not reflect the actual amount of people with the characteristics studied, but rather an estimate of these amounts.
The NIH also relies on the NHANES for population data. According to the survey, more than 2 in 3 adults are considered overweight or obese and 1/3 of children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 are considered obese (NIH, 2012). These and other diagnosis of kidney disease, digestive diseases and anemia promote dietary suggestions and determine the prevalence of disease. It is also important to observe the number of new diagnoses of disease and whether this number increases over time when planning future dietary suggestions.
The NHANES’s biochemical measures include level of water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, trace elements (iron indicators and iodine) and isoflavones and lignans collected from the population by urine excretions and blood samples. The survey’s physical measures include demographics, smoking habits, known conditions, allergies and activity level. By using statistical measures, they are able to determine mean levels of nutrient consumption and inspire ways to improve the population’s diet (CDC, 2014).
It is important to note that some population assessment measures, such as physical examinations, pinpoint disease and issues only after symptoms appear. Meanwhile, other measures, such as lab tests, may detect disease and issues early on (Whitney, 2013. p. 26). This should be considered when observing prevalence statistics and predicting changes in disease rates over time.

Incidence Data
[
]
(MINIMAL CONTENT - STUDENTS ADD HERE)
Prevalence Data
[
]
Prevalence data is the measurement of the likelihood of a person to have a disease. The prevalence number of cases for a disease is the total number of cases of the disease that exist within a given population. A prevalence rate is the total number of cases of a disease existing in the given population divided by the total population (Basic Statistics, 1999).
When prevalence data is obtained regarding dietary assessments, it is typically from nutritional epidemiological studies. The dietary assessments are comprehensive evaluations of the dietary intake of the patients. As a result, by careful review of the dietary data obtained, risk factors for chronic diseases can be discovered, so that steps can be taken to prevent the diseases (Johansson, 2006).
When the data of the dietary intake is reviewed, it may suggest that the patient may be at risk of developing chronic disease. Then, steps may be taken to help prevent it. Further tests of the patient may reveal more problems before side effects are given the chance to emerge. Examples include malnutrition and anemia.
Several examples of previously conducted studies include a systematic analysis of population health data conducted in 2001. The aim of this analysis was to calculate the global burden of disease and risk factors, separated by regional trends over the span of 1990 to 2001. The analysis of the data collected would then allow the Disease Control Priorities Project to know what diseases to begin with. The disease most important for the DCPP to control would be the one with the highest prevalence rate (Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2001).
Morbidity and Mortality
[
]
Morbidity and mortality are quantitative data that can also be assessed from dietary assessments (Implementing Physical Activity, 2015). Morbidity refers to the illness within a given population. Mortality refers to the number of deaths. A mortality rate is the number of deaths due to a disease divided by the total population. Data collected regarding morbidity and mortality typically come from surveys with defined populations and accomplished through systematic methodology (Basic Statistics, 1999).

3.1 Gastrointestinal System
[

The gastrointestinal tract consists, put simply, of a hollow tube passing through the body.  It is an external part of the body, responsible for processing and filtering ingested material.  It includes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus.  The Gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a duct that expands through the body and it allows food to enter from one end to the other. The inside of the GI tract is known as the lumen, it extends from one end to another.
3.1.1 Structures
[
]
Mouth
The mouth is where the process of digestion all begins. When you put food into your mouth you chemically and mechanically process the food. Chemically your mouth secretes saliva, which contains salivary amylase, a main enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch, creating sugars. The production of saliva is triggered before the food even enters your mouth. Once the food enters your mouth, saliva is even further produced. The mouth also mechanically processes your food with your teeth to grind up the food, making it easier to swallow and enter the esophagus. The mouth also contains your tongue, which helps to propel the food down your throat to continue digestion.
Pharynx
Once the food is ground up by the mouth, it goes through the pharynx, or your throat – a passageway that allows the food to move out of the mouth and into the esophagus. According to Whitney/Rolfes (3.1a) the pharynx shares its functions with both the digestive system and the respiratory system. Since the pharynx is involved with both of these systems, it contains a flap of skin called the epiglottis that separates the two systems and ensures that air enters one while food enters the other.
Esophagus
Once the food reaches the esophagus it becomes a bolus. It moves and enters the esophagus through sphincters that open and close in order for the food to get through. There are two sphincters in the esophagus: one is the upper esophageal sphincter that allows the food to enter into the esophagus, and the other is the lower esophageal sphincter, or the cardiac sphincter, which goes near the heart, through the diaphragm, and then enters the stomach. An interesting fact about the esophagus is that it also prevents the stomach contents from refluxing upward, according to Mayo Clinic and Oxford Medicine.
Stomach
Once the bolus enters the stomach it remains in the upper portion and churns. The stomach adds acid to it so that it can become more of a liquid, and then it becomes chyme. Not only does it provide lubrication to the food, but it also releases the proteolytic enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid to denature proteins and other components. Once the chyme is made, the stomach keeps moving the food along by ways of peristalsis, according to Dr. Gillaspy, a professor at the University of Phoenix. Peristalsis is a way that the muscles of the stomach move in order to move and churn the food in the stomach. It is able to churn the food because it contains an extra layer of muscle that is diagonal. The stomach’s main action is to move food – not to absorb nutrients, yet. Once the chyme is ready to go into the small intestine, it moves through the pyloric sphincter and out of the stomach.
Small intestine
The small intestine is the main organ for digestion. It is here where the food is digested and absorbed into the body in order to access the nutrients from your food. The inner walls of the small intestine absorb the nutrients into the blood stream. The absorption is attained through passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, or active transport. There are three parts of the small intestine: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. According to “Understanding Nutrition” by Whitney/Rolfes, the small intestine “is almost 10 feet of tubing coiled within the abdomen.” (3.1a) The small intestine is very large and folded around the center of your abdomen; this is because it needs to have a maximal amount of surface area in order for the food and nutrients to be absorbed optimally. The way the small intestine increases its surface area is by ways of microvilli. There are also pancreatic enzymes and liver bile brought to the small intestine to allow the chyme to break down into attainable nutrients.
Large intestine
After the small intestine absorbs all of the nutrients out of the food, it travels into the large intestine, or colon, by ways of the ileocecal valve. The large intestine, although shorter in length than the small intestine, is thicker than the small intestine. It surrounds your body with the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. The small tube known as the appendix is attached to the cecum. The large intestine is also responsible for breaking down fibers into fatty acids and breaking down vitamins. The way that the large intestine achieves this is through its abundance of microflora, good bacteria. Additionally, any leftover fluid is absorbed here. The large intestine ends at the rectum, and digestion is finished at the anus.
Anus
The anus is the end of digestion where food is to be excreted. The muscles at the rectum are under voluntary contractions, so as to allow a person to control it himself. These muscles include pelvic floor muscles and two anal sphincters. Once your muscles relax, the sphincters on the anus excrete the waste from your body.
3.1.2 Accessory organs
[
]
Salivary Glands
The salivary glands are located in the mouth and throat and can be split into major salivary glands and minor salivary glands. The major salivary glands are known as the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands and are located near the upper teeth, under the tongue, and on the floor of the mouth, respectively. There are many minor glands as well located throughout the mouth. The function of these salivary glands is to secrete saliva into the mouth. Saliva has a vast multitude of functions from beginning to breaking down carbohydrates while still in the mouth to protecting teeth by neutralizing acidic substances to assisting in chewing and swallowing. Therefore, saliva plays a vital role in the gastrointestinal system and digestion process.
Liver
The liver is located superiorly and to the right of the stomach. It has multiple functions, including several in the digestive system. Primarily, the liver aids in digestion by processing nutrients that the small intestine has absorbed. Using these nutrients, the liver then makes compounds that the body needs to function properly. Another function of the liver in the digestive system is to create bile for secretion into the small intestine where is assists in fat digestion by breaking fats down into liquid form so that the intestinal enzymes can continue in digestion. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and is secreted through the bile ducts when a person eats.
Pancreas
The pancreas is located under the stomach and is almost surrounded by it as well. This gland’s main function in the digestive process is to create a pancreatic juice that contains digestive enzymes to break down macromolecules such as fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. These digestive enzymes are then secreted through ducts into the duodenum, which is the first portion of the small intestine. Once there, the pancreatic enzymes are then able to aid in the digestion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Another function of the pancreas is to secrete insulin, which is a hormone that assists in the metabolism of sugars.
Gallbladder
The gallbladder is an accessory organ to the gastrointestinal system that is located under the liver and is slightly covered by it. The function of the gallbladder is to store the bile that the liver creates between meals. Once a person begins to eat again, the gallbladder’s role is to squeeze the bile out so that it is secreted through the bile ducts into the small intestine. Once the bile is in the small intestine, it can begin to assist with the digestion of fats in the small intestine.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Digestion
Absorption
3.2 Digestion
[
]
Digestion is the process of breaking food into components small enough to be absorbed by the body (Whitney 72). Digestion is the body’s way of getting ready for absorption by obtaining nutrients from food sources. There are bacteria located in the digestive tract that are apart of the human normal flora that help aid in many digestive processes. Multiple enzymes, hormones, and organs work together that makes digestion a daily process.  Digestion is important to the human body because the body uses the nutrients from foods for body functions such as cell repair, growth, and energy to keep us going (National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 2013).
As digestion starts from beginning to end, large food particles are broken down into smaller particles by many gastric secretions to be absorbed by the small intestine. The waste product of digestion results in feces (National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 2013).
The digestive process faces many obstacles during its duration such as food and liquid must be separated from the passageway of breathing so that we don’t choke and food nor liquid goes into the lungs. The body must have an entrance into the stomach passing through the diaphragm. The food taken in through the digestive system needs to be kept moving toward the small intestine at a steady pace so that all processes can take place properly (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
3.2.1 Phases
[
]
Food enters the mouth where it is tasted and the mechanical breakdown, by saliva, and chemical digestion begins. Secondly, the tongue moves the food back towards the pharynx, which is shared by the digestive and respiratory tracts. Thirdly, a valve-like flap called the epiglottis blocks the air passages during swallowing to allow the food to take the right path down the esophagus and into the stomach. Next, the food enters the stomach by passing through a sphincter, which is a muscle that encircle the tube of the digestive tract and acts like a valve. The food is then mashed up and mixed with acid to turn into a semi-liquid food mass called chime. The chime leaves the stomach and enters into the small intestine, where the main site of digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. The small intestine also decreases the stomach motility and slows the secretion of gastric juices. From here, any materials that are no absorbed in the small intestine move on to the large intestine via the ileocecal valve. This valve does not let materials to re-enter the small intestine. In the large intestine, most water and vitamins are absorbed. Finally, anything that is not absorbed passes through the anus and exits as feces (Whitney 72, 73).
3.2.2 Mechanical processes
[
]
The chewing of food begins the mechanical process of digestion. It makes food easier to swallow and increases the surface area in contact with digestive juices. Moreover, the tongue uses its mechanics to push the food to the back of the throat to the pharynx. Next, the esophagus moves the food down to the stomach through rhythmic contractions of the smooth muscles, which is called peristalsis (Whitney 75). As the food moves through the digestive tract, peristalsis is a significant mechanical process.
Digestion: Muscular action
Food travels through the gastrointestinal tract through many different muscular actions.  “Gut motility is the term given to the stretching and contractions of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract” (Kellow and Parkman, 2014).  When food first enters the mouth, it is chewed up into many small pieces so that swallowing is easy.  After food is swallowed, the autonomic muscles of the GI tract take over.
The first muscular action in the GI tract is peristalsis.  There are circular muscles in the GI tract and longitudinal muscles that surround the circular muscle.  These muscles act together to constrict the GI tract and push food through the tract.  “Factors such as stress, medicines, and medical conditions may interfere with normal GI tract contractions” (Whitney, 2013, 3.1b).
Once the food reaches the stomach, another muscular action begins.  The main function of the stomach is to “churn food into a consistency that is easier for intestines to digest” (“The Stomach and its Role in Digestion”, 2015).  To aid in the major breakdown of the food, “the stomach has the thickest and strongest walls of all the GI tract organs” (Whitney, 2013, 3.1b).  The stomach has three types of muscles: circular, longitudinal, and diagonal.  These three muscles work together to push the food, which becomes chyme in the stomach down throughout the stomach.
The chyme is then moved into the intestines to absorb the essential nutrients and then moved to be excreted.  Once in the intestines, the muscular action of segmentation is implemented.  The circular muscles on the walls of the intestines contract and squeeze and mix the chyme.  The chyme is mixed with certain stuff that break down nutrients and absorb them.
The last muscular action the GI tract implements to move food along is sphincter contractions.  There are many sphincter muscles throughout the GI tract that are regulated to open and close in order to move food through the GI tract and block movement of food back up the GI tract.  The first sphincter is at the top of the esophagus, called the upper esophageal sphincter.  This sphincter is activated when you swallow food.  When the food gets to the end of swallowing, it hits the lower esophageal sphincter, or cardiac sphincter, allows the food go into the stomach and blocks the food from going back up into the esophagus.  The pyloric sphincter, at the bottom of the stomach, allows chyme to go into the intestines and blocks it from going back into the stomach.  The ileocecal valve in the small intestine allows chyme to flow into the large intestine.  At the end of the tract, the two sphincters of the anus and the tightness of the rectal muscles keeps waste inside the body until it is excreted.
Chewing
Chewing begins the mechanical process during digestion. Food is broken into smaller pieces that are easier to swallow by the chewing of the teeth, saliva, and the actions of the tongue (Whitney, 75). After swallowing, the rest of the mechanical processes no longer require much conscious thought and the body handles the nutrients as needed.
Peristalsis
Longitudinal muscles surround circular muscle rings, which line the entire GI tract. The tube becomes constricted when the long muscles relax and the rings tighten. Peristalsis is when the long muscles tighten and the rings relax, creating a bulge (Turley, 101). Peristalsis is always occurring and pushes the contents in the intestines through.
Stomach Action
The stomach has both the circular and longitudinal muscles that are seen in the other GI tract organs. However, the stomach also has diagonal muscles. These muscles also contract and relax, like the others. These three muscles push the chyme downward towards the pyloric sphincter. Chyme is a predigested that is formed by mixing chemicals in the stomach (Tortora, 966). The pyloric sphincter prevents chyme from getting into the duodenum of the small intestine. While the chyme is at the bottom of the stomach waiting for the pyloric sphincter to open, the stomach wall will release gastric juices. These juices will liquefy the chyme completely. Once this happens, the pyloric sphincter will open. It opens around three times per minute and only lets a small portion of chyme into the intestine at a time (Whitney 75).
Segmentation
The intestines have circular muscles, which contract and squeeze the contents within them. Segmentation is the contractions that occur in the intestines. These contractions mix the chyme with gastric juices, as well as allowing the absorbing cells of the wall to meet with the chyme. (Whitney 75)
Sphincter Contractions
There are several sphincters located along the digestive tract. They open and close to allow the GI contents to move along at a controlled pace. First, there is the esophageal sphincter, which opens when someone swallows. Then, there is the lower esophageal sphincter that prevents reflux. It is also called the cardiac sphincter since it is close to the heart, which is why the burning in the esophagus from reflux is commonly known as “heartburn.” The pyloric sphincter keeps the chyme in the stomach long enough to be completely liquefied while also preventing the intestinal contents from backing up into the stomach. The ileocecal valve is located at the end of the small intestine. Its purpose is to allow contents to move from the small intestine to the large intestine. The rectal muscle and the two sphincters of the anus prevent the continuous elimination of waste (Whitney 75).
3.2.3 Secretions
[
]
There are five organs that contribute secretions during digestion: Salivary glands, the stomach, pancreas, liver, and the small intestine (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
3.2.3.1 Salivary
[
]
The salivary glands moisten food and helps us taste and swallow the food we ingest (Whitney 76).. The enzyme, salivary amylase, that is secreted out of the salivary glands help with the digestion of starch and other carbohydrates, as well as cleanses the mouth, and protects teeth from decay (Whitney 76). Also, it lubricates the upper GI tract.Salivary glands break down starches and make swallowing easier by secreting saliva. Saliva has a combination of water, salt, mucus, and different enzymes that aid in carbohydrate digestion. Also, saliva protects the teeth and linings of many digestive organs from damaging particles (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
Salivary Amylase starts digestion in the mouth of starch and glycogen, and then pancreatic amylase continues the rest of this digestive process. Salivary amylase hydrolyzes these carbohydrates to simple sugars such as galactose, glucose, and fructose. Glucose is then absorbed by our body in the small intestine (Pandol, 2010).
3.2.3.2 Gastric
[
]
Gastric acid is secreted in the stomach. It helps in digestion by creating the ideal pH for pepsin and gastric lipase and by stimulating pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. Additionally, the arrival of protein in the stomach further encourages gastric output (DiMarino). In the stomach, gastric juice is present and contains the main protein digestive secretion, hydrochloric acid. Sometimes this acid can cause heartburn if it goes back up into the esophagus. Mucus is also secreted from the walls of the stomach to protect cells from the strong acid present here (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
3.2.3.3 Pancreatic
[
]
Secretes bicarbonate to neutralize intestinal contents. Also produces enzymes that digest carbohydrates.The pancreas secretes enzymes that break down carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and then delivers to small intestine for absorption (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). One pancreatic enzyme that aids in lipid digestion is pancreatic lipase. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides (Pandol, 2010). Another enzyme called protease is apart of protein digestion. Proteases are stored and deposited from the pancreas in an inactive form and then later on in the duodenum, trypsin activates them (Pandol, 2010).
3.2.3.4 Liver
[
]
The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder until needed. The gallbladder will then release bile into the duodenum when it is time. Bile is an emulsifier and is mixed with lipids to help absorption of fats in the small intestine. It brings the fat into water so enzymes can break them down (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
3.2.3.5 Small Intestine
[
]
The small intestine has some bacteria that produce enzymes to complete digestion processes (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
3.2.4 Regulation
[
]
3.2.4.1 Hormones
[
]
Released in the blood to regulate activity in the GI tract. They are called enterogastrones. These include, gastrin, which is secreted by stomach, secretin, which is secreted by the duodenum, and the pancreatic secretions vary depending on the food content. These hormones, along with many more, serve to prepare different part of the gut for the arrival of food, in addition to regulation of the digestion of nutrients and the rate at which food moves through the system (Overview of Gastrointestinal Hormones)
3.2.4.2 Nervous system
[
]
Nerve cells help to regulate activity in the GI tract. The sight and smell of food, as well as the presence of food in the gut, stimulates nerves. Nerve signals cause muscle contractions that churn, mix and propel food through the gut at a rate that allows for the absorption of nutrients. Additionally, they stimulate or inhibit digestive secretions (The Enteric Nervous System). Extrinsic and Intrinsic nerves are the two nerve types that control the processes of the digestive system. Extrinsic nerves link the CNS to the organs of digestion. This type of nerve releases chemicals that will either make the GI tract contract or relax. Intrinsic nerves are located within the GI tract and are activated when food particles causes the walls of the digestive organs to expand. These nerves distribute many substances that will either quicken or slow down the movement of food through the GI tract (National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 2013).  3.3 Absorption

3.3 Absorption
[
]
Most digested molecules of food, as well as water and minerals, are absorbed through the small intestine. The mucosa of the small intestine contains many folds that are covered with tiny fingerlike projections called villi. In turn, the villi are covered with microscopic projections called microvilli. These structures create a vast surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed. Specialized cells allow absorbed materials to cross the mucosa into the blood, where they are carried off in the bloodstream to other parts of the body for storage or further chemical change. This part of the process varies with different types of nutrients
.
Stomach
[
]
After traveling through the esophagus and esophageal sphincter, bolus enters the stomach. The stomach is known to be the “temporary storage unit for food" (Wiley 2013). While in the stomach, bolus is mixed with secretions from the stomach that are highly acidic. Once mixed, the bolus becomes chyme. Chyme is a mixture of incompletely digested food and stomach secretions. Some absorption does occur in the stomach, however, absorption mainly occurs in the small intestine. The stomach wall contains two layers of muscle, and in the lining of the stomach there are gastric pits with gastric glands that secrete gastric juice. Gastric juice contains water, mucus, hydrochloric acid, and pepsinogen. Gastric juice is stimulated and secreted by a hormone called Gastrin. Gastrin is secreted once food has entered the stomach and is signaled by the stretching of local nerves (Wiley 2013). Pepsinogen is also produced by the gastric glands, is a part of gastric juice, and is an enzyme that kills bacteria present in food. Pepsinogen is activated to form pepsin through the stomach acids, which breaks proteins into shorter chains of amino acids, therefore, assisting in digestion (Wiley 2013). Once the chyme has moved through the stomach it passes through the pyloric sphincter then enters the Small Intestine. Food remains in the stomach for roughly 4 to 5 hours before it is completely emptied. The pyloric sphincter helps to regulate the rate food empties from the stomach. When one eats a high-fat meal, chyme may stay in the stomach for a longer period of time because the gastrointestinal motility is slowed down by the release of certain hormones. Other aspects that could slow the emptying of the stomach are exercise, sadness, or fear (Wiley 2013). (Postlethwaite)
Duodenum
[
]
The contents of the stomach move to the small intestines for further digestion and absorption. The small intestine consists of multiple parts with the first one being the duodenum, a c-shaped hollow viscus (Luijkx & Jones, 2005). When the contents of the stomach first enter the duodenum it is very acidic. To neutralize the acidic contents, a combination of bile and alkaline juices secreted from the pancreas enter the duodenum in preparation for more digestion. Stomach and duodenum dysfunctions are very common and can lead to heartburn, indigestion and upper abdominal pain. Overall, the absorption of minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients begins at this first part of the small intestines (Stomach and Duodenum, 2015).
Jejunum
[
]
The second part of the small intestines consists of the jejunum and is around 3 to 6 feet long. The ligament of Treitz marks the distinction between the jejunum and the ileum. Villi cover the mucus membrane on the inner surface of the Jejunum and are used for absorption. In comparison to the duodenum and ileum the villi are longer (Belsley, 2015). After the contents of the stomach are broken down in the duodenum, it moves here where the inner walls of the jejunum absorbs the nutrients. There are many circular folds in this part of the small intestine, which increases the surface area for maximum absorption. The jejunum assists in further digesting the contents of the stomach by absorbing nutrients and water that can be used by the body. It is the proximal two-fifths of the small intestine, has a feathery appearance and is located I the left upper abdomen (Jones, 2005).
Illeum
[
]
The last part of the small intestine consists of the ileum. During peristalsis, the muscular walls of the ileum mix and push food towards the large intestines. Located within the ileum are villi that increase the surface area for absorption. The nutrients absorbed here are transferred to the blood stream and liver. Water, some vitamins and fiber remain undigested and are broken down more towards the large intestine (What is the role of Ileum?, 2006).
Colon
[
]
The colon is the longest part of the large intestine and is located in the abdominal cavity. It is divided into four sections, the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. After passing through the small intestines, water, fiber, and some vitamins mix with mucus and bacteria to form feces. The feces will move through the colon and the lining of the colon will absorb some of the vitamins, minerals and water. Feces will continue moving down the colon until it reaches the walls of the sigmoid colon where they will contract and cause the feces to move into the rectum (Large Intestine, 2015)
The colon is the last stage of the digestion process, were remaining materials in foods are absorbed.  The main material that is absorbed in the colon is water, while the colon also absorbs sodium ions and chloride ions (R. Bowen, 1998).  Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a large role in the absorption of nutrients from food, but acts more as the final division between what the body wants to save and expel as waste (Sandle, 1998).
The structural components of the colon are as follows:
The cecum- The beginning of the large intestine that hold food material before it passes through the colon1.
The ascending colon- a smaller tube structure that thins out the food material1.
The right colic flexure- The right turn that the colon makes to wind itself throughout the gut1.
The transverse colon- This is the largest part of the colon.  It moves more than any other part and has a slightly concave formation1.
The descending colon- The part of the colon that heads down towards the rectum1.
The sigmoid colon (the left colic flexure)- The final left turn in the colon1.
The anus- The end of the colon where excretion of fecal material occurs1.
All structures found from the Canadian Cancer Society
The methods of absorption differ for each of the materials the colon absorbs.  For the sodium ions, the ions are transported by the lumen, the space inside the colon, across the inner layer of the colon, called the epithelium, by active sodium pumps located in the membranes of the epithelial cells (R. Bowen, 1998).
The chloride ions are absorbed through the process of exchange.  The colon secretes bicarbonate ions into the lumen which facilitates chloride absorption through the epithelial cells (R. Bowen, 1998).
Finally water is absorbed through the regular osmosis processes that the body uses in the small intestine.  The water is then diffused into the blood from the lumen directly (R. Bowen, 1998).  Once all the materials are absorbed from the digested food, all waste materials are expelled through fecal matter.  The composition of most feces are 75% water and 25% solids, being most bacteria and undigested organic matter (R. Bowen, 1998).
The absorption processes in the colon are a vital step in maintaining body regularity.  The water and other materials absorbed here make sure that nothing ingested goes to waste.  The human body is a highly complex system of processes that require many specialized inputs so achieve efficiency, and the absorption processes in the colon make sure the body gets what it needs.

3.3.2 Transport
[
]
Diffusion
[
]
Within the study of nutrition, the word diffusion is regularly used when discussing the absorption of micronutrients, such as specific ions, and their net change across membranes from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Since these particles move randomly (Philbert 2), diffusion requires no energy or proteins to take place, as items that “diffuse” through a membrane are small enough to pass through the lipid bilayer of cells.  Nutrients within the gastrointestinal tract are of high concentration and through absorption and diffusion move into the bloodstream, an area that contains these nutrients in a lower concentration, to be utilized by the human body.
Facilitated diffusion
[
]
Within the study of nutrition, facilitated diffusion is very similar to normal diffusion in the fact that it too is a natural movement of molecules and large ions across a lipid bilayer membrane and down a concentration gradient. Facilitated diffusion, like normal diffusion, requires no energy and is passive; however, the ions and molecules are so large that they must be transported by transmembrane integral proteins (Pratt 264). These proteins “facilitate” the transport of macronutrients and large ions as they passively move down a concentration gradient.
Active Transport
[
]
Uses energy and protein pumps to move materials in and out of the plasma membrane (Singer). Great example is the sodium/potassium pump.
Active transport which moves molecules against an electrochemical gradient requires energy (Karp, 2008). Active transport uses a transport protein, but uses energy in the form of ATP to move nutrients against the gradient, from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. Energy is needed to overcome the influences of diffusion and osmosis. The mechanism draws its energy from the absorbance of light, the hydrolysis of ATP, or other mechanisms that work together to move particles through their concentration gradients (Karp, 2008).
Endocytosis and Exocytosis
Endocytosis and Exocytosis occurs when molecules are too big to cross through a membrane using passive or active transport. The membrane folds back on itself to form a cavity or pouch where it surrounds and engulfs the molecules. Then, the membrane disassembles and the contents are released on the other side. Endocytosis occurs when molecules are entering a cell membrane, while exocytosis is when molecules exit a cell membrane.

3.3.3 The circulatory system
[
]
Blood
[
]
When glucose is absorbed, it enters the bloodstream. The concentration of glucose in the bloodstream is regulated by the liver and hormones that are secreted by the pancreas. It is pumped by the heart (Whitney 82).
The circulatory system includes arteries, capillaries, veins, blood vessels and the heart. The heart is a major organ involved in the system, and its main function is to pump blood through the body. Messages tell the heart when to pump blood and whether it should pump a lot or a little depending on what is needed (Kids Health, 2015). The blood circulatory system can be very complicated and there are many parts and organ systems involved.The blood circulatory system consists of vessels in which the flow of blood is continuous with the heart, which acts as the pump. As blood moves through the vascular system, it transports materials as needed by picking them up and delivering them where necessary.
The route blood takes throughout the body is as follows: Blood in the right side of the heart leaves by passing through what is known as the pulmonary artery. This blood then loses carbon dioxide and in exchange gains oxygen in the lungs. It then moves through the pulmonary vein to the left side of the heart. Blood can also leave the left side of the heart though the aorta, which is the main artery propelling the blood through the body. From the aorta, blood can either go to the lower body, or to the head and upper body. The blood leaving the aorta that is in route to the lower body can then either make its way to the digestive tract followed by the liver, or to the legs, pelvis, and kidneys. After this, blood returns to the right side of the heart. Lymph, a colorless fluid that is derived from body tissue (this includes the digestive system), enters the bloodstream and is then brought up to the right side of the heart (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
Different organ systems play different roles in the vascular system. Body tissues derive nutrients from the blood and deposit waste such as carbon dioxide back into the blood. The lungs exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen, while the digestive system supplies nutrients. Finally, the kidneys act as a filter for wastes in the blood, (not including carbon dioxide) and excrete them in the urine. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013)
Systemic circulation is what provides functional blood to all of the different body tissues in need. It carries oxygenated blood that is found in the left ventricle, out of the aorta, through arteries, to the capillaries found in tissue. The blood circulates in the capillaries, where certain exchanges occur with cells, and then collects into veins. The deoxygenated blood returns through these veins to the right side, or right atrium, of the heart. (Systemic Circulation, 2015). In short, blood travels this route: Heart → arteries → capillaries → veins → heart. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013)

Lymph
[
]
Within the human body, the Lymphatic System is yet another organ system responsible for the absorption of nutrients. It consists of a collection of loosely organized ducts and vessels that move fluids in the direction of the heart. This system allows for the absorption of nutrients through a one-way passage for fluids from the tissue spaces to enter the blood (Whitney 82). The lymphatic system is dissimilar to the vascular system in that there is no pump mechanism; rather, lymph, a clear yellow tinted fluid lacking in red blood cells and platelets, moves around in the interstitial fluid and gathers into small vessels. Lymph vessels known as lacteals absorb fatty acid macronutrients within the gastrointestinal tract. While the majority of other micronutrients and macronutrients are assimilated into the body through the small intestine to be transported directly to the liver by the vascular system, only large fats and fat-soluble vitamins are transported by the lymphatic system. The nutrient rich fatty lymph, known as chyle is then transported and collected in the thoracic duct, the chief vessel of the lymphatic system, located dorsal to the heart. From the thoracic duct, the fluid is transported to the subclavian vein, where the lymph and its nutrients merge into the vascular system via bloodstream. The vascular system then transports the fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins to where they are needed within the body.
Fat Absorption
Absorption of fats is more detailed than the absorption of other nutrients. Absorption of fats first starts with turning fats into water soluble molecules. Bile acids emulsify fats in order for digestive enzymes, such as lipase, to hydrolyze them and release free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Fats are then absorbed into the lipid bilayer of the enterocyte membrane through simple diffusion. In order for molecules to be transported in the bloodstream, cholesterol, triglycerides and other larger lipids are transported using lipoproteins.  A large lipoprotein, called chylomicron, transports particles through the lymph vessels to be transported to the blood stream (Goodman, 2010). Smaller free fatty acids are transported directly into the bloodstream through the hepatic portal vein to the liver. The upper parts of the small intestine is the most abundant amount of the absorption of fat, but it is also absorbed in the ileum.
Blood and Sugar Absorption
Blood plays an important role in the transport of glucose molecules from the mucosal cells of the ileum to the portal vein. Sugars are affected by the amount of Na+ concentration in the intestinal lumen, if there is a high concentration of Na+ then sugar intake in the epithelial cells is inhibited. Glucose and Na+ share the same carrier molecule, which leads to Na+ and glucose moving in and out of the cell together when intracellular Na+ is low (Ganong, 1999). The Na+ is transported to the lateral intercellular spaces while the glucose diffuses into the bloodstream. Galactose also moves with glucose, however other sugar molecules have their own carrier, or are absorbed by simple diffusion (Ganong, 1999).
Vitamin Absorption
Vitamins are divided between fat soluble and water soluble. Fat soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are first absorbed into the lymph and then the blood, many requiring protein carriers. These vitamins are stored in cells associated with fats and are less readily excreted. Water soluble vitamins, like B vitamins and vitamin C, are absorbed directly into the blood stream and travel freely and are readily excreted in urine.

3.3.4 The method of Absorption
Once food has entered the digestive system, the body will take action toward absorbing its nutrients, approximately four to five hours after being masticated and ingested into the body. Most absorption occurs in the small intestine, which is carpeted with projections termed villi, which are composed of even smaller structures called microvilli. The villi are constantly in motion in an effort to capture any and all nutrients that come in their path, thus breaking them down even further with the help of digestive enzymes, such as pepsin and pepsinogen. Pepsin is the first enzyme in the breakdown of proteins, which is then finished off by accessory enzymes, which includes pepsinogen.  Different classes of macromolecules, vitamins, and minerals are all absorbed via unique processes. Once a nutrient has been trapped by these structures, it will enter either the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Smaller molecules as well as water-soluble vitamins are usually transported directly to the bloodstream and then delivered to the liver. Larger molecules and fat-soluble molecules cluster into strcutures called chylomicrons and then enter the lymphatic system. The chylomicrons bypass the liver at first and enter the bloodstream at a point close to the heart. Since fats are insoluble in water, the formation of the chylomicron allows for the transport of these hydrophobic molecules through the bloodstream, which contains water, and then to their appropriate destination.
3.3.5 Optimizing absorption
It is an urban myth that the combination of one type of food with another when consuming a meal will inhibit the absorption of specific nutrients. On the contrary, it has been found that combining one food with another in a meal can actually optimize the absorption of nutrients in the different foods. By combining particular foods together, an individual can enhance their body’s ability to use each nutrient in the most sufficient manner. Studies have shown that overall absorption of nutrients is a result of the overall composition of a meal in contrast to it being entirely determined by an individual food item. For example, vitamin D is necessary for the absorption of calcium. Without it, an individual is prone to diseases such as osteomalacia (bone weakness due to a lack of vitamin D) or osteoporosis (bone weakness due to lack of calcium). So, the presence of both vitamin D and calcium in dairy products such as milk or yogurt will optimize the absorption of these nutrients. Without the presence of vitamin D, the calcium would pass through the body unrecognized and unabsorbed. Furthermore, another example could be that the vitamin C from some orange slices can aid in the absorption of the iron in a spinach salad. The bioavailability of nutrients can be enhanced in broader methods as well. For example, consuming a meal that contains both fat and fat-soluble vitamins will increase the absorption of those vitamins.

Defining Carbohydrates
3.4 Gut Health
[
]
3.4.1 Cellular turnover
[
]
Dietary fiber, most commonly found in plant materials such as fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and bran, is a very important part of maintaining gut health.  Fiber, also referred to as “roughage” or “bulk”, contains components that cannot be digested by the human intestine. Adding fiber to your diet allows your gastrointestinal tract to essentially be exfoliated, increasing intestinal cellular turnover (Valhouny, 1985).  Just like other tissues in the human body that are sloughed off and regenerated, the inner gastrointestinal cells are no different.  This “sloughing off” allows for a larger bulky stool that can carry impurities out with it like a sponge.
Research has shown that fiber is associated with decreased risks for certain chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, stroke, and gastrointestinal disorders (Anderson, 2009).  Increasing your intake of fiber can also lower blood pressure, promote regularity, help immune function, stabilize blood glucose, and also aid with weight loss.
Unfortunately, most Americans consume less than half of the recommended amount of daily fiber (Anderson, 2009).  Experts warn that it is not recommended to drastically increase your fiber intake because this might induce gastrointestinal upset, such as bloating, diarrhea, and gas.  Instead, it is recommended to gradually increase your intake of fiber so your gut has time to adjust.  A simple trick experts recommend in order to increase your fiber intake throughout the day is to remember to eat the skin of the fruits and vegetables you consume (instead of peeling it off), eat fruits and vegetables raw (instead of steaming or cooking them), and by adding bran to your diet whenever possible.
Dietary fiber comes in two forms – soluble and insoluble. Both of these forms have different purposes for different stages of digestion.  Most fiber-rich foods contain both of these forms, but normally a higher proportion of one than the other (“Fiber”, 2014).  Soluble fiber absorbs water and will turn into a gel-like material, while insoluble fiber cannot absorb water.  Soluble fiber slows digestion through the small intestine, causing a more satiated feeling.  This can be helpful for individuals attempting to maintain a healthy weight or even lose weight.  Research has also shown that soluble fiber can prevent heart disease by essentially soaking up cholesterol as the digestion process progresses.  Soluble fibers can also act as a prebiotic that improves the microflora of the intestine.  Insoluble fiber speeds up the elimination of waste products in the gastrointestinal tract.  This promotes regularity and can increase the amount of fecal matter excreted.
3.4.2 Intestinal bacteria
[
]
The
human microbiome
is defined as the collection of microbes found in or on the human body;
microbes
is defined as microscopically small organisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). The microbiome aids in the protection against infection and inflammation, and maintains mucosal homeostasis and immune health. It also regulates the development of epithelial tissue in the intestine, and is involved in the absorption of nutrients and the digestion of food. The Microflora is known as the non-disease-causing bacteria that lies in the large intestine and carries out various functions in the microbiome. Functions of the Microflora include the digestion of fiber; the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and other compounds; and the production of vitamins K and B12 (Gorbach, 1996). A healthy GI tract has a collection of over 100 trillion microbes, and bacteria includes over 400 different types of these microbes (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). A person’s diet greatly affects GI health, and having a healthy gut promotes proper digestion and protection against disease. The microbiome consists of good and bad bacteria which are responsible for carrying out these functions.
Good Bacteria:
Good bacteria consist of probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Probiotics keep the microbiome healthy, aid in digestion, and improve overall health. Some foods that contain probiotics are yogurts, juices, fermented and unfermented milk, sauerkraut, and pickles (“Probiotics,” 2015). Since antibiotics kill off all of the bacteria in the gut, it is often recommended to eat yogurt while taking antibiotics in order to regain some probiotics that were lost. Prebiotics also work in keeping the intestine and microbiome healthy. Prebiotics are carbohydrates that feed the good bacteria and are unable to be digested. Examples of foods that contain prebiotics include wheat, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, and onions (“Probiotics and Prebiotics,” 2015).
Bad Bacteria:
Bacteria that are known to be disease-causing are referred to as pathogens, or “bad” bacteria. Bad bacteria consist of Bacteroides, E. coli, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus, and more. Bacteroides are the most abundant bacteria in the intestine, and are some of the most resistant bacteria to antibiotics (Wexler, 2007). Bacteroides aid in carbohydrate metabolism, are anaerobic and bile-resistant, can adapt easily to changes in the environment, and have mutualistic relationships with the human body when retained in the gut (Wexler, 2007). Once the bacteria escape the gut, they can cause severe illness and disease. Pathogenic bacteria have shown to contribute to a variety of diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colon cancer, Chron’s disease, diabetes, colitis, and obesity.
Metabolism:
Intestinal bacteria are important for producing enzymes and regulating various substances in the gut. Bacteria specifically synthesize vitamin K, biotin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, and pantothenic acid (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). The bacteria are also responsible for breaking down bile acids, and are able to mediate metabolic effects by producing short-chain fatty acids. Proteins are later broken down into amino acids and peptides, and then fermentation occurs (Blaut & Clavel, 2007). Depending on a person’s diet, the intestinal bacteria can become altered, which can cause changes in metabolism.

3.4.3 Problems in digestion and absorption
[
]
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly known as acid reflux or heartburn is a painful sensation a person feels behind the breastbone when the lower esophageal sphincter allows the stomach contents to reflux into the esophagus. Normally, a person's diaphragm will close so nothing goes back to the esophagus but over time, the diaphragm becomes weaker around the esophagus and can eventually form a hole called the hiatus. If this hole is large enough it can form a hiatal hernia which is when the diaphragm is no longer reinforcing the valve. Acid reflux can happen when a person eats or drinks too much, if he/she is wearing tight clothing, changes position (laying down), or some medications and smoking can cause it. Weight gain can increase the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn symptoms.
Treatment is fairly simple for heartburn not caused by an anatomical defect. Simple changes such as  chewing food more thoroughly, eating slower or eating less at one sitting are all strategies to avoid heartburn. Over-the-counter antacids and acid controllers may also provide relief but should not be used frequently as this may cause problems.
Irritable bowel disease
Irritable bowel disease is an intestinal disorder of unknown cause, however researchers are actively investigating the nervous system's role. It is one of the most common GI disorders, characterized by frequent or severe abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea, constipation, or alternating diarrhea and constipation can also occur as a result of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. In most cases, GI contractions are stronger and last longer than normal, forcing intestinal contents through quickly and causing gas, bloating and diarrhea. However, sometimes the opposite can occur where the GI contractions are weaker than normal causing constipation. Triggers such as eating certain foods or stress can aggravate symptoms but not cause them. Treatment for this disease include avoiding individual foods that aggravate one's symptoms and eating smaller meals. In addition, peppermint oil and antispasmodic drugs may also be effective as treatment.
Food intolerance: Lactose Intolerance
Lactose Intolerance is a very common intolerance where intestinal cells do not produce enough of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is needed to be able to digest and absorb lactose efficiently. In healthy individuals, lactase will break down lactose into galactose and glucose, then they will be absorbed through the lining of the intestine. People with lactose intolerance do not have enough of the enzyme lactose in the bloodstream, thus undigested lactose will sit in the gut. After a little while bacteria will begin to break down the lactose, this will cause cramping, diarrhea and gas to build up in the gut.
Symptoms are usually caused within 30 minutes to 2 hours after lactose is ingested, with common symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea. With a lactose intolerance the undigested lactose becomes an energy source for intestinal bacteria, causing disturbances in intestinal motility and abdominal discomfort (Bhatnagar and Aggarwal,2007).
The severity of symptoms depends on many factors such as how fast the lactose reaches the intestinal mucosa or the rate of gastric emptying (the slower the emptying the more time the body has to try to break down the lactose). Many of these symptoms sound awfully similar to symptoms that people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome experience. As of today there have been many studies looking at the link between lactose intolerance and IBS. (Davis, n.d.)
There are four types of lactase deficiencies. There is the primary lactase deficiency, this deficiency is autosomal recessive and can develop throughout the various stages of life. Next is secondary lactase deficiency, this occurs after there has been damage to the intestinal mucosa or intestinal bacteria. Thirdly, there is congenital lactase deficiency, this deficiency occurs in infants and is very rare. It occurs when infants cannot break down lactose whatsoever whether in breast milk or formula. If left untreated infants can suffer from severe dehydration and weight loss (Genetics Home Reference, May 2010). Lastly, developmental lactase deficiency his deficiency occurs when a baby is born premature.  This is because the production of lactase only occurs when a fetus is at 34 weeks.
Currently, there is no single diagnostic test that is agreed upon, but there are many different types that can be used when appropriate. (Mattar, R. (n.d.). Firstly there is the lactose tolerance test; this test begins with patients being giving 2g of lactose per kg of body weight on an empty stomach. Then glucose levels will be tested in the blood, if there is a rise in glucose levels by 1.11 mmol/L or larger after 60–120 minutes after ingestion, then you will be diagnosed with a lactose intolerance. Secondly, there is the breath hydrogen test; this involves measuring the concentration of hydrogen when an individual exhales. This is due to the fermentation of bacteria in the small intestine. If hydrogen levels increase more than 20 ppm then you are diagnosed with the intolerance. Lastly, there are genetic tests available to see if you have the intolerance, however these tests cannot test for all genetic mutations.
Managing your intolerance requires dietary changes; this does not mean elimination of all dairies. Many people with the intolerance can consume up to 6g of lactose without disturbances. Usually products such as yogurt can be consumed as well. This is due to the bacteria in the yogurt that can digest the lactose itself. People who choose to consume no milk products need to carefully plan their diet, as they run risk for not meeting their vitamin D, claim and riboflavin needs.
Celiac Disease
Celiac Disease (CD) has become very common and people are being diagnosed with this illness more and more every day. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have this disease, that’s 1 in 133 people. CD is a disease that slowly damages the inside lining of the small intestine (see fig. 1). By doing this it interferes with the normal absorption of nutrients from food. People with CD actually have an allergy to a protein called gluten, which is found in many foods. This protein can be found in wheat, rye, oat, and barley. However, when consumed by a CD patient, the body reacts with an adverse reaction by destroying the villi, which are tiny hair like projections on the inner lining of the small intestine. Villi are normally responsible for the absorption of nutrients through the wall of the small intestine directly into the blood stream. If the villi are damaged, a person becomes malnourished, not getting the nutrients the body needs. CD is genetic, but is usually triggered after things like surgery, pregnancy, viral infections, or even severe emotional stress.
Symptoms of this disease vary tremendously. Some people can develop all symptoms, while others, don’t have any at all. These symptoms can occur within the digestive system and in other parts of the body. The most common are digestive symptoms which include: abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, constipation, weight loss, and pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool. These digestive symptoms are more common in children with CD. Adults experience other symptoms including: iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, arthritis, bone loss or osteoporosis, depression or anxiety, tingling numbness in hands and feet, seizures, missed menstrual periods, infertility or miscarriages, canker sores inside mouth, and an itchy skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis.
There’s only one treatment for CD, and that’s maintaining a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. A diet without gluten will prevent further damage to the villi on the inner lining of the small intestine and prevent malnutrition. Patients with newly diagnosed CD are usually sent to a dietitian to learn how to start a gluten-free diet plan. This diet will stop the symptoms and heal existing damage, meaning a person will eventually be able to absorb nutrients from food normally. A gluten-free diet generally means not to consume any food with gluten ingredients; this eliminates wheat, rye, oats, and barley. The most common foods with these ingredients include: bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, baked goods (anything with enriched flour), and some processed foods. Some foods that CD patients are allowed to eat include: potato, rice, soy, quinoa, “plain” meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables. When grocery shopping CD patients should read food labels, this is where all the ingredients of the food are listed. Even things that you wouldn’t expect to have gluten, just might, including vitamins and medications.
Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis
Diverticulosis is a condition that occurs when the body is deprived of fiber. This condition most commonly occurs in the sigmoid colon and results in the formation of sacs called diverticula, which are herniations of the mucosa, that form along the colon wall. The lack of fiber causes the contents of the colon to diminish in size and ultimately the result is that colon is forced to exert a higher pressure on the walls. Over time this pressure can produce diverticula and in extreme cases of diverticulosis a similar condition called diverticulitis can occur which is considered to be a more serious condition.
Diverticulitis is the result of the inflammation of the diverticula. One of the most effective ways to reduce the chance of developing diverticulitis from diverticulosis is through increasing the amount of fiber intake that one is receiving. Previously people with diverticulosis were told to avoid nuts, seeds, and popcorn because it was believed to irritate the walls of the colon. However, this information has not been scientifically proven and there are currently no known specific foods that are known to cause the formation of diverticula. However, it is recommended that someone with diverticulosis eat foods high in fiber such as fruit and vegetables. Consuming foods that are rich in fiber will ultimately soften the stool and cause it to pass through the body smoothly therefore reducing the amount of stress and pressure inside the walls of the colon. Some physicians recommend a liquid diet, however, in order to reduce stress to the colon wall and ultimately foods that pass through the colon with ease are considered advantageous in the case of diverticulosis. Some of the risk factors that are involved in forming diverticulosis is smoking and obesity.
If diverticulitis increases in severity it can lead to diverticula that may burst and leak feces into the abdominal cavity. Eventual surgery may even be required and certain parts of the colon, such as the sigmoid colon, may need to be removed. Diverticulosis is considered a relatively common disease and is frequently discovered through routine colonoscopies. 30% to 40% of all Americans over the age of 50 have been diagnosed with diverticulosis and over half of adult Americans over the age of 70 are eventually diagnosed with diverticulosis. Diverticulitis is a lot less common and only occurs in about 20% of diverticulosis patients. However, if improper colon care and fiber intake is not considered, the chance of developing diverticulitis is considered to be much greater.

4.1 Defining Carbohydrates
[
]
4.1.1 Introduction to Carbohydrates
[
]
Carbohydrates are often given a bad report, even by doctors who certainly should know better. This misconception only serves to further confuse an already muddled public.
The confusion comes about when we try to lump all carbohydrates into one category and fail to differentiate between the different types.
On the other hand, when a differentiation is made, it is often only between two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex.  This even further muddles the discussion.  In this section we will be discussing three types of carbohydrates:
Complex
Simple
Processed simple
First, we will start with the source of all carbohydrates.  All carbohydrates originate from plants.  Carbohydrates have one purpose, and that is to create glucose in the blood, hence the reason for proteins and fats not being listed on the glycemic index. The glucose is then transported through the blood to the mitochondria of each cell where it is used to produce the energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate. Without this high energy molecule, there would be no energy for life's processes. Proteins and fats, the other two macronutrients covered later in this text do not do this.  They are digested in a different manner.
Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients that make up the typical human diet. They make up about half of an average daily caloric intake. Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and cellulose. They are formed via photosynthesis in green plants. This is accomplished in plants via a pigment known as chlorophyll that absorbs light energy. As seen in

, plants convert carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and energy (sunlight) into oxygen (O2) and glucose, a simple carbohydrate. The chemical equation for this reaction is
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → 6O2 + C6H12O6
Figure 4A: Photosynthesis
Some of this glucose is used as energy, some goes on to make cellulose as structural support for the plant, and the rest is converted to alternative chemical forms. Usually, this alternative form is starch, which is stored for later use. The carbohydrates produced by plants are essential for the energy of animals. Animals eat plants and utilize the energy in the carbohydrates through the process of respiration. Respiration takes the carbohydrates from plants and oxygen and converts it to energy, CO2, and water. The energy produced is then used for cell work throughout the body.
Each carbohydrate has the same generic makeup; CnH2nOn, which could also be written as Cn(H2O)n. The formula for glucose is found by using n=6 in this formula. Thus, glucose is C6H12O6.
Figure 4B
shows the structure of glucose. Fructose is a very similar sugar to glucose and they have the same formula, C6H12O6. However, fructose has a very different structure, seen here. The cyclic form of glucose, pictured here, is a 6-membered ring with an intramolecular hemiacetal formed by a straight-chain aldehyde. Fructose, on the other hand, forms a 5-membered cyclic hemiketal from a straight-chain ketone. These different structural formations cause glucose and fructose to have different functions, as well.
Figure 4B: Glucose and Fructose
Glucose is found in some fruits, vegetables, and honey. In the human body, it is known as blood sugar. Fructose is found in fruits, honey, and corn syrup. It is also known as fruit sugar. Glucose and Fructose are simple carbohydrates (monosaccharaides). More complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) are made up of multiple monosaccharaides bonded together. Both complex and simple carbohydrates can be part of a healthy diet.
Glucose is found in some fruits, vegetables, and honey. In the human body, it is known as blood sugar. Fructose is found in fruits, honey, and corn syrup. It is also known as fruit sugar. Glucose, Fructose, and Galactose are simple carbohydrates (monosaccharaides). Sucrose, Maltose, and Lactose are combinations of two monosaccharides (disaccharides) which are also considered to be simple carbohydrates. More complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) are made up of multiple monosaccharaides bonded together. Both complex and simple carbohydrates can be part of a healthy diet.
This group of foods may include vegetables like kale, spinach, broccoli, collard greens, and mustard greens. These are said to be the dark green vegetables. Within these plants you find every vitamin, water soluble or fat soluble known to man. Phyto-meaning plant-chemicals are those compounds science has recently discovered that have protective properties against degenerative diseases such as cancer. These compounds are found only within this treasure chest of preventative medicines of nature. Grains like brown rice are an example of another plant grown for human consumption that falls into the complex carbohydrate category. The reason vegetables still look like vegetables by the time they get to the consumers' table and brown rice remains brown is because they are not subjected to the extreme milling process that produces flour. There are three layers to the rice kernel, husk or hull,(for protection and has no nutrients) bran layer, endosperm, and the embryo. During milling only the husk is removed. The brown bran layer, containing all the vitamins and minerals is left intact.
Monosaccharides
Definition : Sweet, colorless, crystalline structure which contain one (mono) molecule of sugar (saccharide), with the basic CnH2nOn makeup. One of the smallest units in the class of carbohydrates and they cannot be decomposed by hydrolysis. Monosaccharides can combine with one other monosaccharides to form disaccharides or with many other monosaccharides to form polysaccharides.
There are three of these sugars and they are Fructose,Glucose, and Galactose  followed here in detail:

Glucose Also known as blood sugar and Dextrose. It is made in plants by photosynthesis, whereby the light energy works with chlorophyll in chloroplasts to convert CO2 to Glucose. It is structurally, C6H12O6. This the same for all monosaccharides. The difference between the three comes from the arrangement of their atoms. This is what accounts for the varying sweetness among monosaccharides. This sugar is an aldehyde, however. It requires no digestion to be absorbed by humans, thus its use for intravenous feeding. Glucose is essential in the body for energy and for many physiological processes to be carried out. Glucose is one of the two sugars is every disaccharide, when glucose combines with itself, the disaccharide formed is called maltose.

Fructose Also known as fruit sugar, or called earlier, aslevulose. It is an isomer of Glucose found in plants and honey. Honey was turned into Fructose by the bee's enzyme converting by hydrolysis, the compound, Sucrose (the combination of these two simple sugars discussed, and below under Polysaccharides as a Disaccharide.) As mentioned above, it also has C6H12O6 for its structure, but the linear construction is different because it is a ketone. Fructose is considered to be the sweetest tasting sugar. When fructose combines with glucose, the disaccharide sucrose is formed which is also very sweet due to the fructose in its composition.

Galactose Also known as milk sugar. It is not found very often free in food, as it is usually ingested as lactose (the disaccharide that galactose is apart of), but it is found in peas. It shares the same chemical composition of glucose and fructose but the arrangement of its atoms are different. Galactose is much less sweet that glucose and fructose. Galactose, when combined with glucose, forms the disaccharide lactose.

4.1.3 Complex carbohydrates
[
]
Complex carbohydrates form one of the main dietary components. Carbohydrates are one of the three essential macronutrients required for the full functioning of the human body. They include sugars, starches, and fibers. Simple carbohydrates are sugars while complex carbohydrates include starch and fiber. They provide energy for the body, especially the brain and the nervous system. The energy is also used for functions like heartbeat, digestion, breathing and body movement. An enzyme, amylase, breaks down the carbs into glucose that is used for energy. Starch in food must be broken down through digestion before the body can use it as a dietary source.
Complex carbohydrates consist of sugar molecules stuck together in long chains and branches. The body turns both simple and complex carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is used in the cells of the body and in the brain. Any unused glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen for use later. Due to their complexity, complex carbohydrates take a little longer to digest, and they don't raise the sugar levels in the blood as quickly as simple carbohydrates. They act as the body's fuel, and they contribute significantly to energy production.
They are found in a variety of foods, including grains, vegetables and legumes - Examples of foods that contain complex carbohydrates include spinach, yams, broccoli, beans, zucchini, lentils, skimmed milk, whole grains, like, millet, oats, wheat germ, barley, wild rice, brown rice, buckwheat, oat bran, cornmeal, amaranth and many other leguminous plants and vegetables. Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, contain more nutrients and fiber than simple carbohydrates, such as sugar. Products made from these grains are complex too, like, grain bread, pasta, bagels, buns and rolls, macaroni, breakfast cereals. Complex carbohydrates are also low-glycemic, meaning they have a mild impact on your blood sugar and can enhance appetite control, weight management and energy.
Complex carbohydrate foods provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are important to the health of an individual. The majority of carbohydrates should come from complex carbohydrates (starches) and naturally occurring sugars, rather than processed or refined sugars, which do not have the vitamins, minerals, and fiber found in complex and natural carbohydrates. Refined sugars are often called "empty calories" because they have little to no nutritional value.
The daily recommendation for dietary fiber – 14 grams for every 1000 calories – is not met by most. Examples of foods made with refined flour include breads, rolls, buns and pizza crust, which are unfavorable sources of fiber. Instead, increasing consumption of beans, peas, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds and foods with natural fiber would be preferable and more beneficial. Some dairy products such as low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt, or skim milk are also good choices for complex carbohydrates in diet.

Starch
Fiber
Complex carbohydrates include disaccharides and polysaccharides. The main disaccharides include three pairs of monosaccharides: maltose, sucrose, and lactose. All three of these disaccharides include a glucose bonded to either another glucose, a fructose, or a galactose, respectively. Sucrose is table sugar and lactose can be found in dairy products. Polysaccharides are much more complicated and can involve multiple units of glucose or even multiple strings of monosaccharides . Most all dietary fibers are polysaccharides.
Disaccharides are two monosaccharides bonded together by a covalent bond . In “Effect of Diet upon Intestinal Disaccharidases and Disaccharide Absorption,” a group of laboratory rats were made to fast for 3 days and then fed either a high sucrose diet – a disaccharide rich diet – or casein, used as a control group. The first group was observed to have extremely heightened sucrase and maltase activity . This leads us to believe that a high dose of disaccharides can affect one's gastrointestinal tract as well as absorption of other disaccharides and polysaccharides.
Polysaccharides fall into two main groups: starches made exclusively from plant matter, and glycogen made from animals. Cellulose is another common polysaccharide, made from cell walls of plants, consisting of long chains of glucose. However, animals cannot digest this type of polysaccharide as it contains beta bonds that require a certain enzyme present to be digested. Humans do not have this enzyme in their digestive system, which is why cellulose is not considered a nutrient. In humans, the main purpose of glycogen and starch is to act as readily available storage of glucose. When more glucose is consumed than needed at the moment, the liver will store the excess as glycogen. When glucose levels are low, the liver will convert the stored glycogen back into glucose ready for use . Starches are a polysaccharide that contain 300 to 1000 units of glucose bonded together. Starches come from plants, and is formed within a grain. These grains contain a hard outer layer. Humans can digest starches as they are smaller molecules that cellulose and more bioavailable to be used for energy . A study in the IEEE scientific journal on certain types of fungi in China and the polysaccharides extracted from them revealed that the polysaccharides contain anti-aging properties as well as anti-infection and anti-tumor properties .

Defining Carbohydrates
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition

Functions
4.2 Storage
[
]
Pre-Storage Background:
Once dietary carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides, they are absorbed by the cells of the small intestine.  Glucose and galactose are absorbed via active transport, while fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion.  These monosaccharides then enter the capillaries and travel to the liver via the
hepatic portal vein
where hepatocytes metabolize fructose and galactose.  Glucose molecules continue on through the liver and re-enter vascular circulation via the
hepatic vein
, contributing to blood sugar levels and nourish the body’s cells.
Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of energy since they get digested quickly compared to proteins and fats. Important dietary carbohydrates consist of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Some polysaccharides, such as cellulose, are resistant to chemical breakdown so they pass through the intestinal tract undigested. On the other hand, when other carbohydrates are consumed they get broken down into their most elementary form called monosaccharides, which are smaller units of sugar like glucose, fructose, and galactose. About five percent of this process occurs in the mouth and stomach with the help of mastication and salivary α-amylase. The rest of the process takes place in the upper part of the small intestine where pancreatic juice that contains the enzyme pancreatic-amylase can further assist in breaking down dextrins into shorter carbohydrate chains (“Introduction to Nutrition”, 2012). As soon as the carbohydrates are chemically broken down into single sugar units, they are quickly absorbed by the small intestine where they then enter the bloodstream and eventually ends up in the liver. The liver converts fructose and galactose to glucose. Glucose gets transferred back into the bloodstream so it can be transported to the various tissues and organs that need it for energy (Goodman, 2010).
Glucose Stored as Glycogen:
After someone eats a meal composed of carbohydrates, blood sugar rises and β-cells in the pancreas release the hormone
insulin
, inducing the body’s cells to take up glucose for their energy needs.  Any excess glucose, however, is converted into
glycogen
(an animal polysaccharide characterized by long, branching chains of glucose) in the liver and muscle cells.  The liver contains about one-third of the body’s glycogen, whereas the muscles can store two-thirds (which is monopolized mostly by the muscle cells for their own energy needs, especially during physical activity); the brain also stores a minor reserve of glycogen in case of emergencies.
When blood sugar is below normal, the α-cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone
glucagon
, signaling the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream.  The adrenal hormone
epinephrine
also acts on the liver to liberate glucose from glycogen storage during times of stress when the cells of the brain, muscles, etc. need an energy boost.
Glucose Stored as Fat:
Glycogen, however, is only a short-term storage of glucose because it retains water and takes up too much space for the body to maintain reserves for more than a few days (and only a few hours during exercise).  Therefore, to accommodate excessive glucose, the liver metabolizes glucose and reassembles its components into
fat
, sending it to the body’s adipose tissue for more long-term (and practically unlimited) storage.  Since fats provide almost twice the energy (nine kilocalories per gram) as carbohydrates, this fatty tissue is able to store
more energy
into
more compact
units compared to glycogen.  Once glucose has been converted to fat, however, it cannot be converted back into glucose like glycogen can.  During times of carbohydrate deficiency, the body can modify fat metabolism and create
ketone bodies
which can enter the citric acid cycle after being converted to acetyl-CoA; the metabolic pathway proceeds from there to produce ATP, the main energy currency of the cell.  If ketone bodies accumulate, though, a condition called
ketosis
can develop: the pH of the blood and body fluids becomes acidic, denaturing body proteins and possibly resulting in coma and death.  To avoid ketosis, a minimum of 50-100 grams of carbohydrates should be consumed each day.
Carbohydrates don't increase body weight by direct conversion and storage to fat. Instead, an increase in body weight only occurs if energy input is significantly greater than energy output. If a person is consuming more carbohydrates than they are burning for energy, the body converts the extra carbohydrates in the form of glycogen and stores some of it in the liver and a majority of it in muscle; however, the human body is only capable of storing a limited amount of glycogen. Therefore, the carbohydrates that can’t be stored are either oxidized in response to immediate energy demands or converted to fat by the process of de novo lipogenesis. Even though most cells can perform de novo lipogenesis, the process mostly occurs in the liver and adipose tissue because liver cells and adipocytes are particularly well adapted. The first step in de novo lipogenesis is creating a compound called acetyl CoA from glucose and adipose or fat tissue (Herman & Kahn, 2012). The molecules of this compound are then linked together to form triglyceride molecules. When energy stores run low during exercise or because of inadequate calorie intake, the body starts breaking down and converting triglycerides back into glucose to use for energy. Only having a small supply of triglycerides won’t negatively impact ones health, but as the number of triglycerides increase the risk of getting heart disease also increases (“Carbohydrates to Triglycerides”).

4.3 Functions
[
]
Carbohydrates come in many forms – as complex or as simple, as fructose, sucrose, lactose, glucose, and maltose. Carbohydrates consist of starches, sugars, dextrins, and gums. The utmost important function of carbohydrates in the human body is to provide energy - energy for the brain, our muscles, and all the way down to our cells. In addition, carbohydrates are important for regulating our blood glucose levels, enabling the metabolism of fat, and to help prevent our protein intake from being used as our first and main energy source.
An extremely important part of the energy supplied by carbohydrates is to raise low blood glucose levels. This occurs through the breakdown of carbs by the enzyme amylase. When we eat carbohydrates, our blood stream collects the carbs and our blood sugar rises. With the introduction of insulin, our cells uptake the carbohydrates, removing them from the blood stream. However, sometimes too much insulin is introduced, and our blood sugar decreases so much that it goes low – meaning below the lower threshold. When this occurs, we then need to consume more carbohydrates – a form of sugar – to increase our blood sugar.
Carbohydrates come in the forms of complex and simple – where complex sugars take longer to activate in your system, producing less of a spike in your blood sugar, whereas simple sugars react immediately. We need the glucose from carbohydrates to supply our brain and muscles with energy. This is why when we have not eaten in hours and lack an intake in carbohydrates we become weak, faint, dizzy, and cannot function at our full potential.
Carbohydrates are the preferable method of energy formation, instead of protein or fat being used first. Fat will be utilized after the whole supply of carbohydrates has run out. Once fat has started being used due to the lack in carbohydrates, fat fragments start to clump together and form ketone bodies. Although at times the ketone bodies can be a good source of energy, they are usually more harmful than good. When the production of ketone bodies is larger than the rate of usage, ketosis occurs, which affects our bodies’ acid-base balance in a negative way. On the other hand, carbohydrates are also used in preventing the protein we consume from being used as the first source of energy. Similarly to the usage of fats, the protein we consume is used for energy when our carbohydrate glucose storage runs out. Our bodies’ protein tissues are forcibly broken down to make glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is another way to help prevent low blood sugars from occurring, and forms from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids.

2.3.1 Sugar and Starch
[
]
Carbohydrates are sugars, starches, dextrins, and gums. Both sugars and starches are classified as saccharide. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate with the chemical composition of (CH2O)n. Most sugars form ringed structures when in solution. Generally refers to as monosaccharides and disaccharides. Starch is a carbohydrate made of multiple units of glucose attached together in a form the body can digest; also known as complex carbohydrate.(1)
Starches are a form of glucose in plants. The body converts starches and sugars into dextrin. Starches and sugars are broken down into monosaccharides and the glucose is then used for energy.
Energy
The simple sugars in foods that are most important to human nutrition are called sucrose, fructose, lactose, and maltose. The body needs the simple sugar called glucose, so these other simple sugars in food break apart in the body to become glucose which yields energy of 4Kcal per gram of carbohydrate. They do this by coming apart easily at the water connections.
Starches include such foods as potatoes, cereals, wheat and other grains, and rice.
Starches are complex sugars, and complex sugars break down into one of the simple sugars (maltose), and then to glucose by easily breaking apart at the water connections. Essentially, starches are sugars that merely require a few more steps to make them into glucose.
’‘’Lipid metabolism’‘’
Lipids are absorbed from the intestine and undergo digestion and metabolism before they can be utilized by the body. Most of the dietary lipids are fats and complex molecules that the body needs to break down in order to utilize and derive energy from.(2)
Short chain fatty acids enter the circulation directly but most of the fatty acids are reesterified with glycerol in the intestines to form triglycerides that enter into the blood as lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons.
Lipoprotein lipase acts on these chylomicrons to form fatty acids. These may be stored as fat in adipose tissue, used for energy in any tissue with mitochondria using oxygen and reesterified to triglycerides in the liver and exported as lipoprotein called VLDL (very low density lipoproteins).
VLDL has a similar outcome as chylomicrons and eventually is converted to LDL (low density lipoproteins). Insulin simulates lipoprotein lipase.
During starvation for long periods of time the fatty acids can also be converted to ketone bodies in the liver. These ketone bodies can be used as an energy source by most cells that have mitochondria.

Abstract
The current research of glucose balance is ever increasing in breadth and depth of understanding.  Glucose balance is a hot topic and  includes the major illnesses of obesity and diabetes.  From glucose supplements, hip contemporary healthy ‘how- to’ books, notable lectures and nutritional philosophies; glucose is certainly the topic of the day.  It has been a curious process to find a starting point in which to explain the central concept of glucose balance while sifting through the morass of data.  This brief unscientific overview is aimed at the fundamentals of what glucose is, why we need it and a general sense of what happens when we have too little or too much of this life giving simple sugar.
Glucose Balance
Glucose  is a simple sugar derived from carbohydrates in our food.
A steady supply of glucose provides our body with an energy source in which to support healthy functioning and life.  Too much or too little glucose in our blood stream can have unhealthy effects to our body.  Staying in balance supports healthy functioning.
Glucose balance (glucose homeostasis or blood sugar regulation) is dependent upon two hormones, glucagon and insulin.
The presence of these hormones regulates the absorption of glucose.
Insulin allows absorption of glucose and glucagon stimulates the liver to release more glucose .  Our brain and muscle tissue are primary receivers of glucose and utilize it as an energy source.  When glucose is not absorbed for energy use, it is deposited into fat cells as storage.  A simple diagram found in a journal of Nature shows how this is coordinated between the liver, pancreas and other organs in the body.
Finding the right glucose balance is specific to your unique genetic disposition.  Talking with your doctor can provide clues to what your balance would look like.  Healthy eating practices and eating nutritionally dense foods are continually stressed throughout the research on glucose.  And there is little, if at all, research finds that symptoms of an unbalanced glucose balance yield desirable outcomes for people.
Two major conditions with evidence pointing to blood glucose are diabetes
and obesity.  Obesity researchers are finding how the brain senses glucose and how this is linked to obesity and metabolism.
Where can we find glucose and what food choices are better for us to consume?  These are both broad questions and will not be the focus of this short study.  However, there can be some quick comments made to examine this question.   Understanding carbohydrates and digestion of carbohydrates will aid in the choices you make.
Since carbohydrates are mainly found in plants, consider the fiber intake of these plant based carbohydrates.
It is suggested that glucose absorption can be influenced by the fiber you are consuming.  And eating whole foods, fiber and all, will aid in the proper balance of glucose in most people’s diets.

The body uses glucose or energy if glycogen stores are unavailable. If glycogen stores are depleted, protein is used to create glucose through the process called glycogenesis. It is important to have enough carbohydrate present in the diet to prevent the need to breakdown protein for energy.
The accumulation of ketone bodies in blood is known as ketosis. It upsets the acid-base balance in the body. The body uses glucose to make body fat when carbohydrates are consumed excessively.

Cholesterol balance
Other Functions of Carbohydrates
Dietary fibers are the structural components of plants and are found in all plant  foods such as vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. The bonds between their monosaccharides cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes in the body, unlike starches. Therefore, they contribute little to no energy. Dietary fibers provide structure for plants and are not able to be broken down by human enzymes.
Soluble fibers are found in oats, legumes and citrus fruits. They are associated with protecting against heart disease and diabetes by lowering blood cholesterol and glucose levels by reducing LDL cholesterol levels. They stimulate the growth of bacteria in the stomach which helps to break down food so that it can be used as energy in the body. Soluble fibers bind with fatty acids. Stomach emptying is prolonged by these fibers. Fiber slows the absorption of glucose and facilitates the passage of food through the GI tract.
Insoluble fibers do not dissolve in water or form gels and are less readily fermented. These are found mostly in whole grains and vegetables. These fibers promote bowel movements, alleviate constipation, and prevent diverticular disease. Insoluble fiber causes toxic waste to move through the colon much faster. It helps to keep an optimal pH in the intestines to protect against diseases.
Abstract: This section looks at arguably the most important macronutrient in our diets: carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are an important part of the body as they are the primary source of energy for cells. Without them, various functions including but not limited to metabolizing energy, storing energy, sparing proteins, and building macromolecules would not be possible.
The main function of carbohydrates is to provide energy to cells throughout our body . After a carbohydrate is consumed, it’s broken down into smaller units of sugar – fructose, galactose, and glucose – in the stomach and small intestine . Once broken down, these sugars enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver where fructose and galactose are converted to glucose .
When glucose is needed immediately to provide energy to the cells, the metabolic process of glycolysis begins . Glycolysis is essentially just splitting glucose and results in the products pyruvic acid and ATP. Following glycolysis, glucose is broken down in the mitochondria where one carbon and two oxygen atoms are removed to produce more energy for the cells to utilize . This energy is transported to the cells in another form, thus making it useable .
When the body has an adequate amount of energy to support its functions, the excess glucose is stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen . Usually, because the body has an adequate amount of glucose, another function of the carbohydrates is to spare proteins from having to break down as a source of energy. However, in a case where there isn’t enough glucose in the body and carbohydrate intake is inadequate, proteins are then broken down and used as a source of energy . The process breaks down amino acids in muscle tissue therefore causing proteins to lose their primary role as building blocks for muscles .
Another important role of carbohydrates is assisting in the assembly of macromolecules . The glucose that isn’t used to make energy is converted to ribose and deoxyribose, which are building blocks for RNA and DNA, as well as ATP and NADPH . NADPH is a very important macromolecule that serves in various chemical reactions and protects against oxidative stress .
In addition to that, carbohydrates, specifically glucose, also play an essential role in the central nervous system . The brain is sensitive to low levels of blood glucose because glucose is the brains only source of energy, unlike in other parts of the body . A lack of carbohydrates can result in hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, which can cause physical and mental fatigue, as well as contribute to dizziness and weakness in the body .
If all these functions of a carbohydrate are sufficiently met, excess glucose can also be used to make fat .

4.4 Sugar's Bad Rap
[
]
Sugar can be found in several foods and drinks, but it has always had a bad rap.  It is important to understand the difference between natural and added sugars.  Natural sugar includes those that are found naturally in foods, such as fruits and vegetables.  Added sugars are those that are not found naturally in foods.  Some of the main sources of added sugar include soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, fruit juices, candy, desserts, prepackaged foods, and sweetened yogurt.
It is important to understand the dangers of excess added sugar.  Sugar is extremely addictive, so, once a person eats a small amount, he or she will begin to crave more.  Excess sugar intake can negatively affect your immune system, and it also causes an increase in belly fat.  An excess amount of fat around the waist can be very dangerous.  Abdominal obesity raises the risk of both type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  One study showed that those who consumed “twenty-five percent or more of their daily calories as sugar were more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those whose diets included less than ten percent added sugar."
Sugar can also negatively affect a person’s metabolism.  In a condition known as metabolic syndrome, a person is at higher risk for high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.  Studies have also shown that a high intake of added sugar can make the symptoms associated with ADHD worse.
Artificial sweeteners have been another topic open for debate.  Artificial sweeteners are used as sugar substitutes because they have fewer calories.  Artificial sweeteners can be commonly found in soda, “sugar-free” candy and gum, dairy products, jams, and other processed foods.  Because artificial sweeteners are so much sweeter than regular sugar, they only need to be used in small amounts.  Many people consume or use artificial sweeteners whey they are dieting because of the low calorie count.  Diabetics also commonly use artificial sweeteners.  Because artificial sweeteners do not contain a high amount of carbohydrates, they do not raise blood sugar levels like sugar does.  Although artificial sweeteners contain fewer calories and carbohydrates, they should still be consumed in moderation.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for each artificial sweetener.  One type of artificial sweetener, saccharin, was linked to bladder cancer in rats, so the sweetener had to have a warning label.  One of the most common types of artificial sweeteners is aspartame, also commonly called NutraSweet.  Some studies have shown an increased risk of certain types of cancer for those who consume excessive amounts of aspartame.  Some people are born with a birth defect that causes a buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the body that causes a disease called phenylketonuria (PKU).  People with this defect should always avoid aspartame.  Like sugar, it is important to limit the intake of artificial sweeteners.
There are several controversies surrounding added sugar. Perhaps the most troublesome is the fact that there is a theory that supports that highly concentrated forms of sugar such as high fructose corn syrup and table sugar may be addictive. It becomes addictive because as the primary fuel of the brain sugar could increase serotonin levels. The mechanisms for this are still currently debated. Nevertheless, there are more established molecular mechanisms for diseases that are the result of excess sugar. For instance, obesity has been linked to excess sugar consumption. And even further, scientist have uncovered that aside from the essential primary role sugar serves as ATP provider, sugar can also significantly alter the composition of protein and fat molecules when it adheres to them. This in turn may alter the way cells recognize each other.
Now questions arise when we consider the ethics of large food corporations and their abused use of sugar. Products that contribute to this are candies, sodas, desserts, and sugar sweetened drinks (such as Iced Tea). According to American Heart Association the highest amount of added sugar a male can consume a day is around 37.5 grams this amounts to about 9 teaspoons, and the highest amount of added sugar a female can consume a day is around 25 grams which amounts to about 6 teaspoons. Now if we should be eating so little added sugar, then products such as Coca-Cola/Pepsi that average to about 71 grams of sugar per bottle should not be allowed on the market. These severely sugared drinks are an extreme form of sugar consumption. If one bottle of soda contains so much added sugar, then an individual has clearly surpassed their daily intake. Also, due to the excess, he or she should probably not continue consuming added sugars for the rest of the day. However, this is seldom the case. More often than not we see individuals drinking a soda that is accompanying their already sugary meal. The result of the voluntary abuse is all kinds of diseases from Type 2 diabetes to obesity. These diseases’ put a toll on individual’s body, and it is a well-established notion that obesity increases a person’s likelihood of cancer, so sugar indirectly contributes to cancer. Moreover, overconsumption of added sugars results in an unhealthy diet. This occurs because sometimes individuals whom consume large amounts of added sugar have trouble meeting their other nutritional needs, since they receive most of their calories from sugar.
4.4.1 Diabetes
[
]
Diabetes is a disease process that occurs due to the carbohydrates metabolism and insufficient hormone insulin in the body. There are the Diabetes Type 1 and Diabetes Type 2, also there is the Gestational Diabetes (GDM).
Type 1 Diabetes: it occurs to children, teenagers or young adults. So in this case they are insulin-dependent because the body doesn’t produce more or there is a little insulin in their body. Pancreas beta cells no longer produce insulin once the body immune system has attacked and destroyed them.
People with this form of diabetes need to do some things:
Injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood.
Need to choose the correct food.
Physical Activity
Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol
Type 2 diabetes:  The Pancreas produce insulin, but when the Diabetes Type 2 occurs the body stops producing insulin partially or completely. It refers to the insulin resistance. And there are associated things to it:
Diet and physical inactivity
Increasing age
Obesity: The obesity happens because the insulin resistance lead to elevated blood glucose levels
. Stress.
GDM is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy.
Women with gestational diabetes may have obese children due to their gestational age once they receive more insulin than necessary.
Syndrome metabolic is associated with many risk factors among them we can have: cardiovascular diseases, abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes (caused by the insulin resistance).
There are many risks of metabolic syndrome: dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, elevated levels of apolipoprotein B, particles of LDL-cholesterol and small, dense low HDL-cholesterol), hypertension and hyperglycemia.
Symptoms are:
Thirst
Frequent urination
Fatigue
Hunger
Weight loss and weakness
Visual changes
Slow healing of cuts and bruises
Itching of the skin, or feminine itching in women
Pain or numbness in the toes and occasionally the fingers
No symptoms at all
Without proper management they can lead to very high blood sugar levels which can result in long term damage to various organs and tissues. Some complications are:
Eyes: Glaucoma and retinopathy
Foot and skin complication
Nephropathy, once high levels of blood sugar makes the kidneys to filter blood much more than necessary, therefore kidneys work level is increased
Neuropathy: There are many reasons for having neuropathy, one of them is: excess blood glucose can injure the walls of tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs
Treatment:
Type 1 Diabetes: People need to be aware of all information on treatment including the different types of insulin available (1). Thus, it is very important to know the type of insulin to be taken.
Management: With the recent technological advances in today’s society, there are now a plethora of options for diabetics to effectively manage their diabetes. One recent advancement that has allowed diabetics to have tighter control of their blood sugar levels is the constant glucose monitor. A constant glucose monitor consists of a small catheter inserted underneath the skin that checks the glucose levels in the tissue fluid. A transmitter is attached to the sensor which is able to send the blood sugar levels through radio waves to a receiver, that then displays the blood sugar levels onto its’ screen.
The transmitter is equivalent to about the size of a quarter which can be placed can be placed on the abdomen or gluteal area. The intention of these devices are to give a patient an overall idea of their blood sugar trends including where they have been and where they are headed. This allows for diabetics to be able to take care of a blood sugar high or low before their it reaches dangerous levels. The receiver that displays the blood sugars is also able to transmit a sound that alerts a patient when their blood sugar has become high or low. This is beneficial because diabetics do not always feel their levels dropping or rising, therefore they are alerted when their blood sugar reaches an alarming level so they are able to take care of it.
One advancement that has also greatly impacted the lives of many diabetics are insulin pumps. Insulin pumps are devices that deliver insulin into the skin via a catheter 24 hours a day. There is a steady rate of insulin that is released throughout the day, along with doses to compensate for the carbohydrates a person eats. Through these methods, the insulin pump is able to act like a functioning pancreas, which contributes to greater blood sugar control. The pump prevents diabetics from taking multiple injections of insulin a day. Instead the insulin is released from the pump which then runs through a series of a tubes before being inserted into the body through the catheter. This prevents the pain of multiple shots of insulin a day and the build of scar tissue that is often associated with repeated injections. The insulin pump is often used in conjunction with the constant glucose monitor, allowing for the ultimate control of blood sugars for diabetics.
The constant glucose monitor and the insulin pump are typically used on type 1 diabetics, but recently type 2 diabetics have also begun to take advantage of the all the benefits these products offer.
These technologies have made it possible for diabetics to live close to normal lives. They have provided diabetics with a better way to regulate blood sugars and have paved the way for future technology to improve the lives of diabetics.
Type 2 Diabetes: there are many treatments for it:
Diet control: People need to eat right food combination because in the nutrition area there are some goals: controlled sugar blood, meals plan, loss or maintain weight. Also it is necessary to have their food in the correct time
Gymnastics or body activity: it is important for having controlled diabetes, it decreases insulin resistance and increases insulin sensitivity, lowers triglycerides, the blood fat that contributes to clogged arteries, helps regulate blood pressure and others.
Test blood glucose
Oral medication
Insulin injections: their blood glucose levels remain too high and insulin treatment is recommended by their doctor.

American Diabetes Association - Planing Meals
This website not only shows you how counting carbohydrates if that it helps you to know what is a glycemic index, what effects has the glycemic index of a food and how it impacts on your sugar spikes. Also there are examples of foods with its glycemic index.
American Diabetes Association- My food Advisor
This website goes to help you track the foods that you are eating and give you ideas for recipes and tips for eating out.
USDA Carbohydrate counting and Exchnage list:
ADA-carbohydrate counting:
Full exchange list (2008) from mayo clinic:
These website goes to help you to begin counting carbohydrates through the exchange lists. This exchange system help your health care team decide if changes in medication and or your meal plan should be made with the aim of keep your blood sugar level within your target range.
Moreover, it's allow you can to substitute servings or types of foods from one list for other on the same list. In this way you can have an individual meal plan.
4.4.2 Dental Caries
[
]
Caries are the result of the destruction of the tooth structure; it happens because of bacterial effect, acid, plaque and tartar.
Caries is the result of poor hygiene in the mouth. Also people eat foods containing carbohydrates such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, cakes, or candy that are left on the teeth. Carbohydrates increase risk of tooth decay.
The bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods mentioned above, turning them into acids. The acid form tooth plaques and later these plaques can be turned into caries. Its more common in back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth.
When people don’t have treatment against the caries it can cause more problems such as: pain, infection and tooth loss.
Treatment
The treatment can depend on how your caries are, but the dentists usually use the following:
Fluoride
Teeth restoration what can make the teeth functioning much better.
Crowns or “ caps” are used in some cases, however crowns are not very a good treatment once it causes  teeth weakness
Root canals treatment
Prevention:
People need to do three things for having a healthy mouth: brushing the teeth at least twice a day using fluoride toothpaste, flossing and mouthwash.
If you don’t brush the teeth, you can wash your mouth before eating and drink water.
Be careful with quality of some foods (snack, fermented carbohydrates and drinks) in your diet.
4.4.3 Hyperactivity
[
]
According to the “Instituto Paulista de Déficit de Atenção – IPDA” this is a syndrome with characteristics of oblivion,
being easily distracted, impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, aggressiveness, and similar behaviors.
According to “Paulo Gonçalves – Especialista em Hiperatividade” he believes that it is related to genetics, the same characteristic of genetics and environmental.
Family history can intensify hyperactivity symptoms (when family doesn’t have structured family, clean rules, and determined time for do many things and others), also habits you learn in the life.
There are many causes:
Consumption of artificial yellow food and aspartame
Sugar consumption such as food, such as : chocolate,  sweets and  drinks for example: soft drink
Alcohol used in pregnancy once it can cause brain damage and drugs
Lead poisoning can cause symptoms same of hyperactivity
Deficiency of vitamin  (calcium, magnesium, Vitamin B6, omega-6 and  omega-3)
Sexual abuse
Sleep deprivation
Family history
Anxiety and depression
Treatment:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -  psychotherapy.
Audiology because many people or children who have this syndrome are not able to read very well because they can have dyslexia and dysorthographia.
Some medication: psychostimulants, medication atomoxetine (Strattera), methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Daytrana), dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Dextrostat) and others.
Supplementation of vitamin, minerals and nutrients
Eliminating sugar specifically, it does suggest to the parents to avoid giving food additives to their children once it might be better to avoid it as these foods contain aspartame.
Homeopathy: Doctors have worked in herbal remedies and natural substances that in large doses would actually cause some of the symptoms of hyperactivity
Prevention:
During pregnancy:  Don't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or use drugs
Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins
Put together a daily routine for your child with clear expectations that include such things as bedtime, morning time, mealtime, simple chores and television.
Work with teachers and caregivers to identify problems in advance.
4.4.4 Obesity
[
]
Obesity has increased since 1970 and thus the chronic diseases, diabetes, hypertension and others have risen in children and adults.
As these diseases have appeared in many Nations, they have become an epidemic, a crisis of public health
Obesity can be classified thrum two methods:
1º Body mass index (BMI) is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in meters squared.
This is a standard method however its classification can vary for children, adults and old people.
2º People with very fat waists (94 cm or more in men and 80 cm or more in women) are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.
so, these measures are  very important for determining health outcomes related to obesity and to metabolic syndrome.
Below there are some factors that contribute for having obesity problems:
Genetics:  Some syndromes can cause obesity because there is mutation or chromosomal abnormalities, such as Prader–Willi and Bardet–Biedl syndromes.
Gender: More prevalent in women.
Also more common in Australian women
http://www.preventativehealth.org.au/internet/preventativehealth/publishing.nsf/Content/E233F8695823F16CCA2574DD00818E64/$File/obesity-2.pdf
Once men have a very fast metabolism than the women. However, in accordance to the CDC study in 2009 and 2010 the obesity prevalence did not differ between men and womenhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db82.pdf, but  others believe that women tend to be more overweight than men.
Physical activity:  People live a sedentary life style.
Psychological factors: Individuals who suffer from psychological disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety, and eating disorders) may have more difficulty controlling their consumption of food and maintaining a healthy weight.
Once the search for food can give them comfort, distressed also they can transfer to the food their feelings such as: sadness, anxiety, stress, lonely, and frustration.
Malnutrition: Malnutrition is found in the food profile of the families nowadays once they consume industry food which is rich in fat, carbohydrates, sugar and sodium. On the other side they do not use to have vegetables, salad, fruits and cereals.
Pregnancy: During the pregnancy women need more macronutrients and micronutrients; however they eat much more than necessary what make them to get fatter. After having their babies they face more difficulty in coming back to their previous weight.
These factories have their consequences in the  health such  as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, heart problems, hypertension, dyslipidemia (for example triglycerides and high cholesterol), Coronary disease, some cancers (for example: breast, colon, endometrial (related to the uterine lining) prostate and kidney, breathing problems (for example: asthma,  sleep apnea)
“Excess weight reduces the quality of life, raises medical expenditures, places stress on the health care system and results in productivity losses due to disability, illness and premature mortality.”
In order to avoid this situation the treatment should be in accordance with the diseases; changing the food habit and having regular physical activity for adults and children.
4.4.5 Hypoglycemia
[
]
Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels get too low. Symptoms of hypoglycemia usually occur when blood sugar levels are below 70 mg/dL
. Symptoms of Hypoglycemia include but are not limited to: dizziness, hunger, shaking, weakness, increased pulse, and sweating. If you experience hypoglycemia and do not try to increase your blood glucose, you could be susceptible to decreased concentration, coordination, passing out, and coma.
Hypoglycemia can commonly be seen in diabetics and can be caused by multiple factors. In diabetics, specifically, too much insulin intake can lower glucose levels to a point where hypoglycemia occurs. As well as insulin, diabetic medicines like Amaryl or Glucotrol can dangerously lower blood glucose to a dangerous point if not taken properly or with food consumption. Low blood glucose can also be seen in diabetics if alcohol is ingested with aspirin, Probalan, Zyloprim, or Coumadin
.
Hypoglycemia can be avoided by remembering to ingest food with simple sugars after taking insulin or any diabetic medication. Common foods that can raise blood glucose levels quickly include orange juice, hard candies, sodas, honey, or glucose tablets
.
A common symptom of hypoglycemia is passing out. If someone passes out due to hypoglycemia, a glucagon injection can be served to increase their glucose levels quickly. If food or juices are administered while passed out, there is a high possibility of choking in the patient.
Hypoglycemia is a possibility in those not diagnosed with diabetes. There are two types of hypoglycemia that can affect those unaffected by diabetes: reactive hypoglycemia and fasting hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia happens four hours after meals are ingested and is also known as postprandial hypoglycemia. Fasting hypoglycemia is also known as postabsorptive hypoglycemia and is attributed to some kind of underlying disease. Symptoms of both types are the same as hypoglycemia seen in diabetics
.
Reactive hypoglycemia is seen when blood glucose levels are below 70 mg/dL and can be relieved by eating. The cause of reactive hypoglycemia is still unsure but is thought to be attributed to more sensitive release of epinephrine or insufficient release of glucagon in the body
.
Fasting hypoglycemia is seen when blood glucose levels are below 50 mg/dL and is after sleeping, physical activity, or in between meals. Fasting hypoglycemia can be attributed to hormonal deficiencies, tumors, ingestion of alcohol, hyperinsulinism, illness, medication, or tumors. When someone has fasting hypoglycemia tests and treatment can usually correct the underlying problems
.
It is possible for someone to be unaware of hypoglycemia; this typically happens when the brain does not communicate with the body and no symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia are shown. This case is when hypoglycemia can become life-threatening
.
4.4.6 Heart Disease
[
]
Sugar has always had a bad reputation when it comes to weight gain and cavities.  However new studies show that sugar may be a leading cause in the increased risk of dying with heart disease.  A study was done on the risks of added sugar and the results clearly exemplified the hazards of added sugar.
They showed that “participants who took in 25% or more of their daily calories as sugar were more than twice as likely to die from heart disease when compared to those who only took in 10%”(Eating too much sugar increases the risk of heart disease, 1).  From here, scientists concluded that, “the risk of dying from heart disease rose in tandem with the percentage of sugar in the diet” (Eating too much sugar increases the risk of heart disease, 1).  This held true regardless of a person’s sex, age, weight, body-mass index, and physical activity level.  In this study, researchers also considered whether it was possible that sugar wasn’t the factor that was increasing these risks, but just the lack of fruits and veggies in a person’s diet.  However, when researchers measured the participants Healthy Eating Index that showed how well there diets matched up with federal dietary guidelines, it became clear that “Regardless of their healthy eating index scores, people who ate more sugar still had higher cardiovascular mortality” (Eating too much sugar increases the risk of heart disease, 1).
Taking in 25% of a person’s daily calories through sugar may seem extreme and unlikely, however about 1 in every 10 Americans do it.  The biggest sources of added sugar in people’s diets include sugar-sweetened beverages such as energy drinks, sodas, and sport drinks.  Because of these types of lifestyle choices that American’s make daily, they are increasing their risk of heart disease.  Exactly how this sugar is increasing the risk of heart disease hasn’t yet become clear.  However, research has shown that eating and drinking an excess amount of sugar can raise blood pressure.  It is also known to stimulate the liver to dump more excess fats into the bloodstream, both of which are known by scientists to increase a person’s risk  (Sugar: Killing us Sweetly.  Staggering Health Consequences of Sugar on     Health of Americans, 2).
Researchers believe that there may be other factors that cause sugar to increase the risk of heart disease besides these two reasons also and believe these will become clearer after further research studies are done.  Specific guidelines for fats and sodium are offered, however there is no known “limit” for sugar.  There is however pretty outdated advice dating back to 2002, recommended by the American Heart Association, saying that women should consume less than 100 calories from daily sugar.  This is now known to be unreasonable, however experts do believe that the least amount of added sugar you can consume on a daily basis the better (Sugar and Cardiovascular Disease, 1).  For most people, this may include kicking a soda habit or replacing their sweets addictions with more fruits and veggies.
4.4.7 Alternative Sweeteners
[
]
Alternative sweeteners are a type of sugar substitute that can be used for many different reasons. Many people use alternative sweeteners to help aid in weight loss. They can also be used to help control blood glucose, weight gain, and dental caries (Whitney). The reason alternative sweeteners are used for weight loss is because they contribute zero calories (Artificial). This, in turn, means that alternative sweeteners provide almost no energy to the body (Whitney). There are both benefits and drawbacks to alternative sweeteners, and in moderation, they are typically okay. However, in larger doses, alternative sweeteners can be harmful.
Some of the common alternative sweeteners are Acesulfame potassium, Aspartame, Saccharin, and Sucralose. Acesulfame potassium is found in the brands Sunnett and Sweet One. Aspartame is found in Equal and NutraSweet. Saccharin is found in SugarTwin and Sweet’N Low. Sucralose is found in Splenda (Artificial Sweeteners). Some of these sweeteners come from naturally occurring substances, but overall, they are synthetic sugar substitutes (Artificial). Besides being found in small sugar packets; alternative sweeteners are commonly found in processed foods. They are so popular, because they are typically sweeter than just sugar. For example, another type of alternative sweetener, Advantame, has a relative sweetness to pure sucrose of 20,000 to 1 (Whitney).
A few of the benefits of alternative sweeteners is that they don’t promote dental caries, they can help with weight control, and people with diabetes can use them as an alternative to sugar. Artificial sweeteners don’t raise blood sugar levels, and therefore are generally okay for diabetics to use (Artificial). For those looking to lose weight, artificial sweeteners are very attractive. Alternative sweeteners are called “non-nutritive” sweeteners, because they provide no energy to the body (Whitney). With this in mind, it is more appealing to use artificial sweeteners instead of the table sugar, which is a high calorie food. Reduced calories, along with exercise and good diet, can result in weight loss.
Although there are benefits to alternative sweeteners, there are also some drawbacks. The most glaring concern of alternative sweeteners is their contribution to causing cancer. Studies have not confirmed that alternative sweeteners can cause cancer, but there was a scare with saccharin in the 1970s that linked it to bladder cancer (Artificial). This label has since been dropped, but it is important for alternative sweeteners to not exceed the recommended intake, regardless. The Food and Drug Administration has set guidelines for the intake of alternative sweeteners, and these are known as the acceptable daily intakes (Whitney). As with many other foods, alternative sweeteners should be used in moderation, and they need to be a part of a balanced diet.
'Dangers of Artificial Sweeteners'
Although there are benefits to alternative sweeteners, there are also some drawbacks. As with many other foods, alternative sweeteners should be used in moderation, and they need to be a part of a balanced diet. Because artificial sweeteners can be up to 7000 times sweeter than table sugar they have the tendency to make your taste buds less receptive to natural sources of sweetness, for example the sweetness in fruits or in milk. This can cause a person to want foods that are sweeter and sweater causing them to eat more foods that are unhealthy like candy and sodas instead of fruit.
Artificial sweeteners can also interfere with the breakdown of food in a person’s stomach. When a person eats something sweet the brain signals the stomach that something containing high calories was just eaten and is on its way.The stomach then prepares for the large amount of calories, but when only a small amount of calories arrive its too late the stomach is ready to break down a large amount of calories.This causes the stomach to break down food inefficiently, which can cause problems. Also when something sweet enters the mouth the brain also signals the pancreas to release insulin.Even though it would not be needed, causing confusion
in the body.This confusion can cause a person to over eat.The stomach wants to match with what was tasted in the mouth.If the mouth tastes a lot of calories but only a few are delivered to the stomach it can cause a persons body loose control of how much they eat. Causing a person to want to eat more to mach the taste of sweetness that was in their mouth.
Although diet sodas contain artificial sweeteners that have no calories, studies have shown that people who drink diet sodas with artificial sweeteners regularly are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than people who don’t drink soda at all. Studies also show that people who drink diet soda tend to be more over weight than people who drink regular soda. A well-known artificial sweetener is sucralose. Sucralose is made by chlorinating sucrose. This process is done by chemically substituting three chlorine atoms for
three hydroxyl groups. The problem with this is that chlorine is a well-known carcinogen. There are no real long term studies on the affect of sucralose or other artificial sweeteners as a result know one really knows how safe or how dangerous they will be in the long run. This just proves there are no short cuts. Instead of drinking as much diet soda as you want thinking it is perfectly safe. It is safer just to drink regular soda in moderation.
4.4.7.1 Sugar Alcohol
[
]
Sugar alcohol is another popular alternative to sugar. Also known as Polyols, sugar alcohols occur naturally in food and come from plants such as fruits and berries. Common types of sugar alcohols are mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltitol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH). Sugar alcohol is found mostly in foods labeled "sugar free" or "no added sugar" such as gum, hard candies, cookies, soft drinks and throat lozenges, toothpaste and even mouthwash. Despite the name, there is no ethanol in sugar alcohols and does not affect the liver.
There are few benefits to consuming sugar alcohols verses regular sugar. This sugar alternative does not cause tooth decay and contains a low glycemic index. Sugar alcohol requires little to no insulin to metabolized. As such, blood sugar does not spike due to the slow conversion process of sugar alcohol to glucose. Sugar alcohols also contain fewer calories than sugar or other sugar substitutes, such as sucrose, making it a very appealing alternative.
However, sugar alcohols are not easily absorbed by the body and must be broken down in the large intestine by gut bacteria. Sugar alcohols may have a laxative type of effect when ingested in large quantities. Excessive amounts eaten in short periods of time can cause symptoms like gas, bloating and diarrhea. Weight gain has been seen when these products are overeaten.
Sugar alcohol differs from other artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and aspartame. First, sugar alcohol contains an average 2.6 (1.5-3) calories per gram where other artificial sweeteners contain zero. Another difference is sugar alcohols contain carbohydrates where other artificial sweeteners do not. To calculate the number of carbohydrates sugar alcohol contains in a product, refer to the nutrition label.  Take the total number of sugar alcohol grams and divide it by 2, then subtract that number from the total number of carbohydrates.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Dietary intake Carbs
Defining Proteins
4.5 Dietary Intake Carbohydrates
[
]
This is personal, but exist reference what correct in any country  for example:
Dietary reference values for the intake of nutrients by Americans and Canadians - Adults should get 45 percent to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates.
4.5.1 Dietary Intake Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are where the body gets most of its energy. Two carbohydrates that the body needs to fuel about half of its everyday activities are glycogen and glucose (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014). People don’t ingest glycogen and glucose, instead they ingest carbohydrates which provide for glucose in the body (Whitney& Rolfes, 2014). The extra glucose is stored into glycogen for the body’s later use or to reserve energy. Carbohydrates are often thought of as bad for the body because when ingested in added sugar form such as in soda, cookies, or candies, they can be detrimental. However, if carbohydrates are ingested in their natural form, such as in legumes, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, they are helpful to the body. Low fat milk and low fat yogurt also contains what can constitutes as a “good” carbohydrate (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014).
Athletes or active people typically need more carbohydrates in their diet because they use extra energy during their work out or sport. People should consume forty five to sixty five percent of their daily calories from carbohydrates (Coleman, 2014). This varies with every person depending on how many calories they consume in one day.
Carbohydrates exist in three forms: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. The most important form of carbohydrates for nutrition is a monosaccharide called glucose. Glucose is also known as “blood sugar” and it holds the main role in carbohydrate metabolism. When glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, it yields energy to fuel the brain and muscles in the body (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014). Carbohydrates yield four calories per gram.
In order to calculate one’s carbohydrate requirement they must first know how many calories are adequate for them to consume in one day. Men usually need more calories in one day than women do, thus their carbohydrate intake should be higher than a woman’s (Coleman, 2014). In a regular diet people should consume more carbohydrates than they do protein or fat. For example in Australia, when a person has a two thousand calorie diet, they should have 310 grams of carbohydrates a day versus the seventy grams of fat and fifty grams of protein (Daily Intake Guide, 2011). Adults who drop their calorie intake for weight loss, need about half of their daily calories from carbohydrates. Once a person has calculated their adequate daily calorie intake, they can calculate how many carbohydrates to consume by calculating forty five to sixty percent of their calories and then dividing by four (Coleman, 2014). This will result in the number of grams of carbohydrates they should consume daily.

4.5.2 Low-carbohydrate diets
[
]
Definition
[
]
A DASH diet recommends a diet that is 50-65% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 20-35% fat.  Low carbohydrate diets range between 5-30% carbohydrate.  As protein intake tends to be  fixed at 10-20%, carbohydrates and fat must be traded in order to ensure adequate caloric intake.
Overview
[
]
There are many different types of low carbohydrate diets.  By restricting carbohydrates to roughly less than 150 grams/day, glucose, and thus insulin is decreased.  High levels of insulin, especially in those that are insulin resistant, increase the level of fat storage.  When insulin levels are low, either long after a high carbohydrate meal or nearly all the time if someone is on a low carbohydrate diet, free fatty acids accumulate in the blood stream.  This increases energy availability and decreases hunger sensations as cells have a steady supply of energy.
When very low carbohydrate diets (less than 50 grams/day), an alternative metabolic state is entered.  Free fatty acid release is significantly up-regulated and a metabolic state known as ketosis is entered.  Ketones may be measured using "ketostix", which are available at drug stores.
Effectiveness of Carbohydrate Diets
[
]
Cause of Heart Disease
[
]
There are two models of heart disease, the Lipid Hypothesis and the Carbohydrate Hypothesis.
Lipid Hypothesis
[
]
The Lipid Hypothesis states that a diet high in saturated fat will raise blood cholesterol, which will increase the risk for plaque formation and thus heart disease.  Fat also has 9 calories/gram, while protein and carbohydrates have 4 calories/gram, and alcohol has 7 calories/gram.  The well accepted nutritional advice states that fat makes you fat because it has more calories/gram.  This was proposed by Ancel Keyes in the early 1960s, and after the 1972 conference governed by United States Senator George McGovern, lowering fat intake became the standard recommendation.  People such as Dr. Robert Atkins fought the recommendations, but ultimately did not convince the committee.
Carbohydrate Hypothesis
[
]
The Carbohydrate Hypothesis is an alternative, largely untested, hypothesis for what makes people fat and what causes heart disease.  High carbohydrate diets, especially those high in refined carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, pasta, and sugar raise blood glucose levels very quickly.  Glucose, which can react with small, dense LDL, must be put into the cells.  The pancreas releases large amounts of insulin, which stores the glucose in the fat cells in the form of fat.  In between meals, fat is released and provides the individual with energy.
Chronically high insulin levels will cause muscle cells to become insulin resistant.  The muscle cells down-regulate insulin receptor activity and thus the glucose stays in the blood where it can cause problems.  The pancreas must produce more insulin in order to store the glucose, which increases the risk of fat cells becoming insulin resistant.  When the fat cells are insulin resistant and there is free floating insulin in the blood stream, free fatty acids release is down-regulated.  An individual then experiences hunger, as their alternative source of energy is no longer easily available.  They then overeat, which increases their caloric intake leading to weight gain.  If they do not overeat, their metabolism will be decreased in response to their decreased energy availability, despite eating an adequate number of calories.  People do not get fat because they overeat, people overeat because they're getting fat.  It's a starvation response and lowering caloric intake, which will promote weight loss, will also promote muscle loss.
Carbohydrates also increase the small, dense LDL particles and triglycerides, whereas saturated fat increases large, buoyant LDL and HDL.  The small, dense LDL particles can get under the arterial cell walls, where the can oxidize and form a plaque.  This plaque necessitates increased arterial pressure leading to high blood pressure and an enlarged heart to pump blood at an increased pressure.  If the plaque is large enough and breaks, it may form a clot in the brain, heart, or other vital organ leading to strokes, heart attacks and other damage.  If the plaque does not detach, but the heart continues to work hard, heart disease may occur.
Ketosis
[
]
In biology, ketosis is a state of the organism characterised by elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood, by the processes of lipolysis and beta-oxidation.
Ketone bodies are formed from excess amount of fat break down. Some of these ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and ß-hydroxybutyrate can also be used for energy.
When glycogen stores are not available in the cells, fat (triacylglycerol) is cleaved to give 3 fatty acid chains and 1 glycerol molecule in a process called lipolysis.
Most of the body is able to utilize fatty acids as an alternative source of energy in a process in which fatty acid chains are cleaved by coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl-CoA, which can then be fed into the Krebs cycle.
Acetyl-CoA can only enter the Krebs cycle bound to oxaloacetate. When carbohydrate supplies are inadequate to maintain blood glucose levels, the liver naturally converts oxaloacetate in the liver to glucose via gluconeogenesis for use by the brain and other tissues.
Excess acetyl-CoA in the liver is used to produce ketone bodies, leading to a state of ketosis. During this process, a high concentration of glucagon is present in the serum, which inactivates hexokinase and phosphofructokinase-1 (regulators of glycolysis) indirectly, causing most cells in the body to use fatty acids as their primary energy source.
Condition usually caused by diabetes and accompanied by dehydration, hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and increased levels of glucagon. The high-glucagon, low-insulin serum levels signal the body to produce more glucose via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and ketone bodies via ketogenesis.
During times when you can't eat (like when you are sleeping, when no food is available, or just when you are busy) your body switches over to burning the fat stored from last week's mammoth binge, and creates molecules called ketones or ketone bodies.
The ketones can be used by your cells in place of the missing sugars, thanks to the body's ability to switch metabolic pathways on the fly.
In other words, since you've burned up all your stored glycogen, and you don't have any new food coming in, ketosis kicks in, and your body uses the fat that was stored from a previous meal to fuel itself.
Contrary to popular rhetoric, a ketogenic, low carbohydrate diet is NOT a high protein diet. It's a high fat diet, with a moderate protein and a very low carbohydrate intake. A typical ketogenic meal includes some sort of protein, a source of natural fats (butter, cream sauce, olive oil, or coconut oil) and green leafy vegetables, such as in the picture at right.
Ketosis vs Ketoacidosis
The difference between the two conditions is a matter of volume and flow rate:
Benign dietary ketosis is a biochemically regulated and controlled process which results in a mild release of fatty acids and ketone bodies.
Ketoacidosis is a condition in which massive, way above normal quantities of ketones are produced in an unregulated, wildly out of control biochemical situation.
Critics of low carbohydrate diets express concerns about the long-term health consequences of ketosis. The idea behind ketosis producing diets (typically very low-calorie diet programs) is to force the body to lose weight by burning body fat.
Supporters of low carbohydrate eating plans claim that low-carbohydrate-diet induced ketosis is safe. They point out that dietary ketosis should not be confused with ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition associated with untreated Type 1 Diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin. They argue that ketoacidosis doesn't occur in normal healthy individuals because the presence of insulin keeps ketone production in check so that only a mild, beneficial ketosis is achieved.
Zero Carb Diet
[
]
Overview
Zero carbohydrate diets can lead to quick weight loss, which has made several of them very popular. At the same time these diets usually call for followers to eat animal products such as meat, eggs and sometimes dairy. Avoid carbs. If you never eat another carb you wont’t die. Eat meat and fat. Eating wrong meats like sausages which have carbs in them can lead to other health problems along the way.
Benefits
:
Weight loss: This diets to lose weight, since the body first burns glycogen, which comes from the consumption of carbohydrates, for energy. Without these carbohydrates in your body, you begin burning fat for energy, which leads to weight loss and right sizing. Your body will become its natural weight.
Appetite control: That's often exactly what happens with low carb, high fat diets - you tend to eat less automatically - so appetite control appears to be a legitimate benefit of low carb diets. Zero carb diets are more satiating diets. You never feel hungry.
Another potential benefit of carb restriction is better glycemic (blood sugar) control.
This diet has a higher thermic effect and a decrease in appetite.
Disadvantages:
Foods with higher fat values, such as many proteins, usually contain more cholesterol. A high-cholesterol diet increases your chance of contracting heart disease, cancer and diabetes. You could also deprive your body of vitamins and minerals found in many carbohydrates that remain essential to your overall health.
When the person do this type diet also he/she doesn't have micronutrient and macronutrients, take headache, nausea, weakness, dizziness ab other</ref>
Paleo Diet
[
]
Overview
This diet is based in the caveman diet, Stone Age diet and hunter-gatherer diet. The paleolithic diet (abbreviated paleo diet or paleodiet), also popularly referred to as the caveman diet, Stone Age diet and hunter-gatherer diet. The ancestors would have thrived on during the Paleolithic era, the time period from about 2.6 million years ago to the beginning of the agricultural revolution, about 10,000 years ago.
Just eaten beef, pork, lamb, poultry, and game meat, if you can get it), fish, seafood, fresh fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and healthful oils (olive, coconut, avocado, macadamia, walnut and flaxseed). Dairy products, cereal grains, legumes, refined sugars and processed foods were not part of our ancestral menu.
Benefits
: When diet do to reduce food intake and exercise, this is will weight loss and consequent increase the risk chronic diseases
But, according with Pedro Carrera Bastos believes this:
Obesity
Cardiovascular disease (heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis)
Type 2 diabetes
Cancer
Autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, etc.)
Osteoporosis
Acne
Myopia
Nearsightedness, macular degeneration, glaucoma
Gout
Varicose veins, hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, gastric reflux.
Disadvantages
Unbalanced diet
High saturated fat consumption
Totally new eating habits
4.5.3 High-Carbohydrate diets
[
]
High Carb Low Fat (HCLF) Vegan diet
[
]
Veganism is defined as not consuming anything derived from animals, including eggs, dairy, honey or meat; not consuming anything that contains animal products. In addition, a high carbohydrate, low fat diet is when you increase carbohydrate intake and decrease fat consumption, including added sugar and fat. The majority of the carbohydrate intake comes from fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Versatility of food combination is immense due to essential nutrient rich foods, for example servings of protein can contain legumes, tofu, chickpeas, nuts, peanut butter, spinach and a numerous amount of other protein rich foods. In addition to this fruits and vegetables become the main source of healthy fats, oil, protein, starch, sugar, and fatty acids. This diet is primitive for fat burning; this is due to the result of the increase in carbohydrates intake and its consequential ability to spike insulin levels which therefore increase cellular capability to absorb fat.
Advantages
Following a HCLF vegan diet has the ability to reverse chronic diseases such as diabetes and reduce cardiovascular risk factors with the addition of weight loss. Research has evinced that vegan dieters have the ability to lower their risk of ischemic heart disease by 57% in comparison to meat-eaters. Low LDL cholesterol levels can be achieved as well as reduced triglycerides levels and systolic blood pressure. Because being overweight increases risk for Type 2 diabetes, HCLF vegan diets can reduce weight and significantly lower blood sugar over time, and can potentially decrease dependency on diabetes medications. A higher intake of fiber can promote greater bowel health and movement which can aid in reducing risks of colon cancer. Due to the high intake of phytochemicals contained in plant-based foods it can increase immune response and potentially prevent cancer, as well as boost enzyme activity that protects against infectious antigens and increase antioxidants throughout the body. Low animal product intake can result in lower risk/rate of breast and prostate cancer. By decreasing the amount of calcium and dairy consumed it alleviates arthritis symptoms and can also relieve rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, and cardiac pain. When the consumption of dairy, meat eggs, and honey is completely expunged it helps diminish environmental obligations such as the reduction of carbon dioxide emission, decrease of resources used to sustain animals, instead less resources are required to grow and maintain plants.
Disadvantages
Quickly transitioning into a HCLF vegan, “weaning”, can result in GI upset and irritable stomach distress, and can potentially develop digestive problems. There’s a risk of not consuming enough calcium which consequentially causes bones to become more fragile and increases the possibilities of fractures and osteoporosis. If the diet is not balanced many deficiencies can arise, which include zinc, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D. Another deficiency consists of low levels of n-3 fatty acids that are essential for proper cardiovascular, brain, and vision function. Other problems are due to inconvenience when dinning out or meal planning; it takes a great deal of commitment and effort to continuously organize each meal in order to get the sufficient nutrients in each meal, balancing and establishing nutritious consumptions of adequate foods.

Defining Proteins
Protein quality
5.1 Defining Proteins
[
]
All living cells are made up of proteins (n.d.) including substances such as hormones, enzymes and antibodies that are necessary for that organism to function correctly.
Proteins are essential for life. They are a group of complex organic chemical compounds that are made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sometimes sulfur that is composed of one or more chains of amino acids. They are the true workhorses of the body. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including replicating DNA, catalyzing metabolic reaction and responding to different stimuli.  They are an essential part of an organism and take part in nearly all processes that go on within the cells.
They are extremely essential in animal diets as some amino acids cannot be synthesized and must be obtained from our food.  Amino acids are used in metabolism after they are broken down through digestion.
Some foods that are rich in proteins include eggs, milk, meat, fish, tofu and legumes.
There are three different types of proteins based of their composition.
Simple proteins
Conjugated proteins
Derived proteins
Simple proteins are proteins that are made up of  amino acids joined by peptides bonds.  Some examples are globulin, albumins,  histones, albuminoids, protamines, and glutelins.
Conjugated proteins are simple proteins joined with a prosthetic group or cofactor. Some examples are phospho- proteins, chromo proteins, nucleoproteins and glycoproteins.
Derived proteins are obtained from simple proteins using the actions of chemical agents and enzymes and they are not naturally occurring proteins. Some examples include peptides, peptones and metaproteins.
Simple proteins are proteins that are made up of  amino acids joined by peptides bonds.  Some examples are globulin, albumins and gliadins.
Conjugated proteins are simple proteins joined with a prosthetic group or cofactor. Some examples are phospho- proteins and chromo proteins.
Derived proteins are obtained from simple proteins using the actions of chemical agents and enzymes and they are not naturally occurring proteins. Some examples include peptides and peptones.
Amino acids and proteins are the building blocks of life. When proteins are digested or broken down, amino acids are left. The human body needs a number of amino acids to:
Break down food
Grow
Repair body tissue
Other body functions
Amino acids are classified into three groups:
There are three types of amino acids: essential amino acids, nonessential amino acids and conditional amino acids.
The essential amino acids, we don't produce this, so we have to eat the food for obtain. The amino acids isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine can not be synthesised by the body and therefore must be essential components of the diet.
Nonessential amino acids the body produce, so people don't need to eat for obtain this amino acids. They are: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid.
Conditional amino acids: If your system is stressed, out of balance, or diseased, these amino acids become essential and you must get them from food or supplements. They are: arginine, glycine, cystine, tyrosine, proline, glutamine and taurine.
5.1.1 Structure
[
]
There are four levels of organization for proteins to take on. Each level lends a new layer of physical intricacy, and in turn, more diverse functionalities. The phrase “form fits function” is an appropriate mantra for proteins. The four levels are as follows:
Primary Structure
Proteins at their most basic level are patterned strings of individual amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Think of a single protein as a beaded necklace, strung with different beads that all have unique properties (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013). Each protein has its own pattern of amino acids that makes its form different, and thus its function different. The different effects the arrangement of amino acids has comes into play in the next level of organization.
Secondary Structure
Now is when the string of proteins starts to take a distinct shape. The forming is driven by the weak electrical attractions the individual amino acids have to other amino acids (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013). According to Geoffrey Cooper, This is the major form of guidance for the protein, and why the sequence of amino acids in the primary structure determines the functionality of the future protein. Also, molecular chaperones aid in protein folding, and their sole purpose is to help the protein fold in ways it already is predisposed to fold (Cooper, G., 2000).
Some forms that protein strings can take are pleated sheets and helixes (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013). Elmhurst University describes the helix shape as spring-like, with the form stabilized by the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen and hydrogen of an individual amino acid with that of the carbon and oxygen on the amino acids that is 4 amino acids down the string from it. Elmhurst University also states that beta pleated sheets are sheets of protein strings that are bonded side to side by hydrogen bonds, and is planar in contrast to helixes.
Tertiary Structure
The tertiary structure of proteins is when form really starts to represent function. The alpha and beta riddled strings of amino acids begin to fold in on themselves, with the hydrophilic amino side groups facing outward in an aqueous environment, and the hydrophobic side groups facing inwards (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013). It is now easy to see how the order of amino acids in the primary structure is vital to the correct form and function of a protein.
Quaternary Structure
In some cases, proteins need to be organized beyond tertiary structure. Multiple proteins that have attained tertiary structure, otherwise known as polypeptides, can group together to create a larger form (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013).
Misfolding
Protein folding is a complex process and directly influences the function of the protein. Proteins will only properly work in the body if the 3D structure is correct. While most proteins are correctly folded, some can be misfolded or become unfolded during the process. This leads to inactive proteins that cannot be used by the body. Misfolded proteins are a result of proteins not having enough energy to fold to their correct state and can be influenced by temperature or a limited amount of space in the cell (Gregersen, 2006). This is a common occurrence in the cell and is generally corrected by mechanisms in the body. Misfolded proteins can be refolded through chaperone systems, which refold the protein, or destroyed through denaturing (Gregersen, 2006). However, some proteins that are not folded properly may become detrimental to one’s health. Misfolded proteins that accumulate in the body can replicate and cause degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s (Reynaud, 2010). The risk of getting degenerative diseases increase with age because the body is not as efficient in protein refolding processes (Reynaud, 2010).
Denaturing
Denaturation is the process by which proteins are broken down (Ophardt, 2003). During this process, the 3D tertiary structure becomes uncoiled. Because the tertiary structure is unraveled, proteins can no longer function properly. Denaturation can be induced through a strong acid or base, salt, detergent, heat, or mechanical force (Ophardt, 2003). Protein folding is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is a weak interaction; thus, it does not take much effort to denature proteins. After denaturation, the protein is in a “random coil” structure (Ophardt, 2003). This random coil structure is not related to the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures. After a protein has been denatured, it cannot fold back into its secondary and tertiary structures (Ophardt, 2003). Since it cannot reform its tertiary structure, it no longer can function as it originally did, if it can function at all.  Denaturation is almost entirely an irreversible process. Denaturation causes changes in cell activity and even potentially cause cell death (Ophardt, 2003). However, denaturation can also just cause minor changes in color, texture, and physical form.
Denaturation is a common occurrence; it is needed in the body to digest food. An example of denaturation that happens in every day life is the hardening of egg whites and yolks when cooked (Ophardt, 2003). In order for the egg to be edible, it must be denatured through heat. Denaturation is also why meat turns firm when cooked. Proteins derived from food are denatured when they come in contact with stomach acid (Ophardt, 2003).
Complete and Incomplete Proteins
Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids in quantities that meet the body’s needs. These are found mostly in animal-based proteins such as meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs. These proteins typically have better absorption and availability to the body. Incomplete proteins do not contain all essential amino acids, or not in sufficient quantities. Incomplete proteins come from plant foods such as grains, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes. They can be combined to form complete proteins (Morrow, 2012).
Protein Breakdown
Proteins are broken down into amino acids in a catabolic process. Once these amino acids are broken down, they are reassembled into thousands of different forms the body can use for hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters. In order for proteins to break down, the stomach secretes a hormone called gastrin which causes the stomach to secrete gastric juices. The stomach also produces pepsinogen which is converted to pepsin by the hydrochloric acid found in gastric juices. Pepsin is the enzyme that breaks down proteins to peptides. Another digestive enzyme that is secreted by the stomach is protease. Once these peptides move to the duodenum and the pancreas they are broken down further by the enzyme trypsin. In the intestines, digestion of peptides into amino acids is completed with help from peptidase, and these amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream by the small intestine (Gromisch, 2014).
Transamination and Deamination
When too much protein is consumed, amino acids must be broken down and excreted as urea. In order to begin the catabolism of an amino acid, its amine group, NH3, must be removed. An amine group can be removed by transamination or deamination. Transamination is the transfer of an amine group from an amino acid to a keto acid. This is a reversible reaction, as the reverse is used to synthesize nonessential amino acids. Deamination occurs mostly in the liver with the help of catalysts called deaminases. In this process, ammonia is removed and converted into urea, which is less toxic to the body. The urea is then excreted from the body after passing through the kidneys. Transdeamination is a combination of these two types of reactions, otherwise known as coupled reactions. It occurs when transamination is directly followed by oxidative deamination. These processes are both part of the urea cycle. In the urea cycle, the free ammonium ions released from deamination reactions are condensed with bicarbonate ions to form urea. With each cycle, a molecule of ornithine is produced which keeps the cycle in motion. Some genetic mutations can prevent production of ornithine and, therefore, cause malfunction in the urea cycle. This can be life-threatening, as excess ammonia in the body is toxic (Yudkoff, 1999).
5.1.2 Classification of Amino Acids
[
]
Amino acids are known for their role as building blocks of proteins as well as intermediates in metabolism. Their arrangement within a protein in determined by the sequence of bases within a gene that goes on to encode a protein. The chemical properties of these building block then dictates the function of the protein. (Dayhoff, 2003)
There are 20 different amino acids required the make the variety of proteins needed by the human body. These amino acids can be classified either by their nutritional aspects or by their chemical composition, specifically their variable side chain. (Fantar, 2009)
Essential, Nonessential, and Conditional Amino Acids
The human body can only make some of the amino acids on its own, while others must be consumed in the diet.
Essential amino acids, also known as indispensable amino acids, are ones that are not manufactured in the body, therefore they must be obtained through ones diet. The 9 essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. (Gersten, 2012)
Nonessential amino acids are those that the body produces naturally. They are either created from the breakdown of protein products or from other essential amino acids. These acids include: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, ornithine, proline, serine and tyrosine. (Creative Commons, 2012)
Conditionally essential amino acids are not usually required in the diet; however for some they are required at certain stages of growth or are needed by certain people whose body cannot synthesize them (McAuley, 2015). Often a nonessential amino acid becomes conditionally essential when there is a deficiency of a needed precursor for that amino acid. Other instances amino acids become conditional are during periods of stress, aging, or illness (Helmenstine, 2011). For proper development, children should consume arginine, cysteine and tyrosine in addition to the essential amino acids. Another example is patients with phenylketonuria who must reduce their phenylalanine intake due to their condition, which causes tyrosine to become an essential amino acid to the diet, as its production is reduced by the phenylalanine reduction. The conditional amino acids include: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, ornithine, proline, and serine. (McAuley, 2015)
Nonpolar, Polar, Basic, and Acidic Amino Acids
Another form of amino acid classification is based on the charged and polarity of side chains known as the R groups. A single amino acid structure consists of a central carbon atom, an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and the variable side chain that can lead the amino acid to be nonpolar, polar, basic or acidic. (TutorVista, 2013)
Nonpolar amino acids have no charge on their R group and are hydrophobic. These side chains have pure hydrocarbon alkyl groups. The amino acids in this group are alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, glycine, tryptophan, methionine and proline. (TutorVista, 2013)
Polar amino acids will have functional groups such as alcohols, amides, acids, and amines, and they yield a hydrophilic compound. The amino acids in this group include: Asparagine, Glutamine, Cysteine, Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine. (TutorVista, 2013)
Acidic amino acids have an acid functional group as well as the carboxylic acid, yielding two acidic components. Aspartic and glutamic acids are the two acidic amino acids. (Ophardt, 2003)
Basic amino acids have another amine functional group as their R group, yielding a basic solution because this extra amine group isn’t neutralized by the carboxylic acid. Basic amino acids include: Arginine, Histidine, and Lysine.

Protein quality
Synthesis
5.2 Protein Quality
[
]
Foods of plant and animal origin contain different nutrients like proteins, but differ in the type and proportion of nutrients in them. Protein quality refers to the presence of all essential amino acids in the appropriate quantity in the proteins of food. A food protein that contains all the eight essential amino acids (nine for children) in the right proportion is termed a complete protein. On the other hand, a food protein that lack one or more of the essential amino acid is called an incomplete protein.
Hence, this section examines the concept of protein quality and a survey of plant food combination diets of some selected group of people in Abuja (Nigeria).
Essential amino acids
hi camden
Proteins are generally essential in that they cannot be made from fat or carbohydrate, as a result of their component nitrogen that is not present in either fat or carbohydrate molecules. About 20 naturally-occurring amino acids make up the various proteins required by the human body
1
. Among these, some are essential while the rest are not.
There are eight amino acids (nine amino acids, in the case of children) that the human body cannot synthesize. These have to be supplied through diet, and so, are called essential amino acids. They are methionine, valine, leucine, iso-leucine, threonine, lysine, tryptophan and phenylalanine. For children, the additional amino acid is histidine
2
.  Newborn babies may also need a particular amino acid called taurine)
3
. Most foods of animal origin contain all the essential amino acids in the right amount, in contrast to foods of plant origin that usually lack one or more adequate quantity of the essential amino acids.
Limiting amino acids
Plant foods are cheaper sources of nutrients for man, especially in the developing world. However, foods from plant are low in some specific essential amino acids such as lysine, methionine and tryptophan. Such amino acids that are present in low proportion limit the functioning of the proteins, and are so called limiting amino acids of those particular proteins. Generally proteins in cereal like corn are limited in lysine, while pulses like beans are limited in methionine.
Hence, the practice of various food combinations is necessary to ensure that those who depend largely on plant-based foods get complete protein diets. This practice of combining different food proteins is termed complementation; the resulting proteins are complementary proteins.
Bio-availability of Protein
Just as not all rays that strike a solution are all absorbed by the solution in Physics, similarly, not all nutrient intakes are utilized by the body. Some dietary intakes pass through the body unchanged and go out with as waste matter; others are digested but may not get as far as the circulatory system (bloodstream) while others get digested and taken up into the blood for utilization in the various tissues that require them. Bioavailability of protein is a measure of how easily the body (under normal conditions) can absorb the protein in food for its various functions in cells and tissues. Bioavailability is not just only a measure of essential amino acids, but it is also determined by the structure of the protein
4
.
This refers to the ease of being broken down into its component amino acids and dipeptides. This amenability differs among different proteins, depending on the complexicity of their structure (folding). Thus, proteins that are easily unfolded and broken down are more available to the body than complex proteins that are not readily completely digested. A third factor that influences protein bioavailability is the presence of other molecules (such as carbohydrates and lipids) that usually accompany proteins in nature.
Protein bioavailability is usually calculated by using different measures, each giving an incomplete contribution from different angle. According to a website
4
, these measures include Biological value, Protein Efficiency Ratio, Net Protein Utilization, Kjeldahl method and Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (this is the mostly used measure).
Survey on protein quality
A survey was conducted to determine the cultural food habits, with respect to complementary proteins consumption of some groups of people in Abuja, Nigeria. A group of randomly selected men and women from a few communities were administered a questionnaire to gather information on their tribes, cultural food combinations and frequency of consumption of their listed plant-based complementary protein diets. The sample was composed of people from tribal/ethnic groups like Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Ebira, Edo, Tiv, Boki and Eggon. The result of the survey indicated that frequently consumed food combinations of these people include corn and pea, millet gruel and beans pudding, tuwo (cereal meal) and soup, rice and beans, wheat bread and cocoa beverage, beans and corn, wheat and corn, plantain and beans, etc.
Hence, it was concluded that normal cultural food habits of the respondents involve regular consumption of complementary proteins foods.
5.2.1 Essential amino acids
[
]
Essential amino acids are amino acids that the body is incapable of creating given the body metabolism (Nicoteri, 2013). Therefore, the source of such amino acids is the diet.
Foremost, Histidine is an essential amino acid that supports the development and maintenance of tissues in many body areas, especially the myelin sheath. Some of the plant sources of histidine include rye, wheat, and rice. another amino acid is valine, which is important for maximum repair and muscle growth by ensuring that the muscles endure during the body development processes (Shike, 2009). Sources of valine are spinach, beans, and hemp needs. Tryptophan, also given the name relaxing amino acid, is another essential amino acid. It is a neurotransmitter and also aids in keeping the nervous system and brain healthy. Some of the sources of tryptophan include seaweed, chia seeds, and spinach. Threonine is other crucial, essential amino acid. It helps in the body's wellbeing by galvanizing a healthy central nervous system, heart, liver, and immune system. For instance, it aids in the digestion of fatty acids to protect liver failure and buildup of fatty acids. Good sources of Threonine are figs, wheat, and avocados.
Phenylalanine exists in three forms L-phenalynaline, DL phenalynaline, and D-phenalynaline. Phenylalanine converts into tyrosine after ingestion, which is additional amino acid for making brain chemicals, including the thyroid hormones. Its sources include almonds, avocado, and seeds. Methionine is an essential amino acid and it contains sulfur mineral, which supports bone cartilage production (Ballentine, 2010). It is equally important in muscle growth and creatine formation, which are required for maximum cellular energy. Its source includes chia seeds, oats, and legumes. Lysine maintains proper carnitine and hence lowers the level of cholesterol. Some of the sources of lysine are hemp seeds, chia seeds, and soy protein. Isoleucine is a unique form of leucine, which enables the body to produce hemoglobin and energy (Insel, 2013). Further, it propels the growth of nitrogen in the muscle cells. Its primary sources include quinoa, kiwis, and apples. Leucine is important for muscle growth and strength. Additionally, it regulates the blood sugar through insulin moderation after and before exercise. Some sources of Leucine include seaweed, peas, and pumpkin.
5.2.2 Limiting amino acids
[
]
Protein quality is determined by the essential amino acid profile of a certain protein. The more complete the protein is, the higher its quality. Limiting amino acids are the amino acids whose lack thereof inhibits proper protein synthesis and thus lowers the protein quality of a certain source. For example, lysine (an essential amino acid) is consistently found in much lower concentration in plant-protein foods than in animal foods and it is most likely to be the limiting amino acid in a diet based mostly on cereals (Young & Pellet, 1994). Modest amounts of legumes or animal proteins can offset lysine imbalance in such diets. Within plant proteins, soy protein is considered of better quality that corn protein. (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). Corn is 9.4% protein and has a lysine score of 49 while soybean is 36.5% protein and has a lysine score of 115 (Young & Pellet, 1994).
   In general it is helpful to try consuming high quality proteins over low quality proteins. Higher quality can be described as a source of protein that has several, if not all, of the essential amino acids. The essential amino acids include Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine. Limitation of amino acids is also based on the quality of the protein one is consuming, such as digestibility and its ability to support growth. This can be linked to bioavailability, as some forms of protein may be more bioavailable than others. This is especially important for vegetarians or vegans. Although it is possible for vegans and vegetarians to meet all their protein needs it may come with the act of needing to take a wide variety of plant based proteins in order to consume all the essential amino acids. Complementary proteins, eating several food sources that contain different amino acids, are a great way to prevent limiting amino acids (Whitney & Rolfes).
When a diet is limited in even one amino acid the body’s entire process of protein synthesis is limited. Let’s say you were to build a wooden bucket to fill with water. If you ran out of wood and one side of the bucket was shorter than all the others, you can only fill the bucket as high as the lowest wall. The same concept is behind protein synthesis, explaining why limited amino acids can cause problems in several bodily processes (PROTEIN & AMINO ACIDS). Proteins (built by amino acids) play a role in transportation, acid-base regulation, hormonal activities, enzymatic processes, regulation of fluids and structure such as that of collagen in teeth or bone. To limit one or several essential amino acids can throw off an array of bodily processes (Whitney & Rolfes).
	Histidine, although produced in the body in small amounts, the quantities are so low that it is still considered an essential amino acid. Histidine is important in production of hemoglobin, tissue building, and strengthening of the immune system as a whole. Because of this, Histidine is especially important for someone healing from an injury or going through normal growth. Because of the amino acid’s link to immune function, lack thereof can lean to increased likelihood for infection and worsening of allergies. A lack of supply can be even more serious in the younger population, as children rapidly grow and Histidine aids the process. This can lead to stunts and disruptions in normal growth and development. Soybeans, chicken breasts, and beef are all excellent sources of this essential amino acid specifically (Amino Acid Studies).
5.2.3 Bioavailability
[
]
Bioavailability refers to the digestibility of a protein. Proteins from animal sources have around 90-100% digestibility while plant proteins have 80-90% digestibility compared to the reference protein (egg) which has a perfect protein quality score (Young &Pellet, 1994). Animal proteins have a more complete amino acid profile along with higher digestibility which make them of higher quality, however, adequate intake can be achieved with strictly plant-protein sources.
5.2.4 Plant Proteins
[
]
Animal proteins are considered complete (containing all essential amino acids) while plant proteins are considered incomplete. Plant proteins have a more diverse amino acid content pattern but are usually missing one or more essential amino acids. Plant protein sources include legumes, grains, seeds, vegetables, and nuts. Those who follow a diet free of animal protein can get their amino acid needs by eating a wide variety of the above listed plant protein foods. A good strategy used all around the world is protein complementation, the pairing of two incomplete proteins to make a meal that contains a complete amino acid profile. A good example of protein complementation is a rice and beans meal, a staple of many Latin American countries where people may be less likely to be able to afford animal protein (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). It is important to say that complementary proteins do not have to be present in the same meal or consumed at the same time as long as the average daily intake meets or exceeds the recommended amounts. Also, soy protein is considered of high nutritional value and can be used in combination with most cereal grains to improve the overall quality of the total protein intake (Young & Pellet, 1994).
Plant proteins, contrary to popular belief, are good sources for protein. The body does not require large amounts of protein in order to function. In fact, only 1 out of any 10 calories consumed needs to come from protein (Mangels, 2013). The body also does not need animal protein. Instead, the body requires twenty amino acids, nine of which are called essential because the body does not produce enough of them. They are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Our diet must provide these nine amino acids for our bodies. They are found in the protein we eat and serve as the building blocks for protein in the body. Without all twenty amino acids, a protein cannot be made (Whitney, Rolfes, 2002). Many, but not all plant proteins, provide all of the nine essential amino acids. The sources of food that produce all essential amino acids are considered high quality. Among them are quinoa, soybeans, and spinach. Other sources of plant proteins include black beans, chickpeas, peas, almonds, cashews, peanut butter, and broccoli. It is recommended that a person’s diet is varied, so that throughout the day, they are meeting all their nutrient needs, including protein. If they do this, they will most likely meet all of their protein needs without having to worry about missing out on a particular amino acid. This is important for those who only consume plant proteins, because if they consume a vegetable that only provides 7 of the 9 essential amino acids, then they will make up for it simply by snacking on cashews later on in the day. Furthermore, high protein diets are not advantageous for one’s health. Getting the right amount of protein is good enough. People who consume plant based
diets typically get 10-12% of their kilocalories from protein. Those who are not on a plant based diet tend to consume around 14-18% (Mangels, 2013). Benefits of plant based proteins include the fact that they’re alkaline-forming. Our body’s pH is naturally in an alkaline state. Animal protein is acid-forming, and so when it is digested, the body must take minerals from the bones to sustain its alkaline pH. Meat consumption is also a source of saturated fat in the diet. High saturated fat intake
is correlated with risk of heart disease. A plant based diet consists of more unsaturated fats and so lowers this risk. A final benefit of consuming plant proteins is that the environment isn’t used up in the production of plants as much as it is when raising animals. Animal meat requires the use of water, land, and energy to be produced. Plant production simply takes up less space and fuel (Brazier, 2013).

5.3 Synthesis
[
]
The process of protein synthesis can be broken up into two main steps: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process of creating mRNA from DNA, and translation is the process of creating a protein from the mRNA.
The DNA in our cells holds all the necessary information for protein synthesis. In the nucleus of a cell, RNA polymerase unzips the DNA to begin the formation of the RNA. C and G nucleotides match up and A and T nucleotides match up. However, whenever an A is found on the DNA, the RNA polymerase places a U on the RNA. For example, if the sequence of amino acids on the DNA were ATCG, the sequence on the mRNA would be UAGC. This is the process of transcription to messenger RNA, or mRNA. The mRNA is carried outside the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Dobson, 2000).
It is important to note that the mRNA will not code for the entire DNA, it will code for a portion of the DNA strand that is necessary to create the protein needed at that time. (Teacher’s Pet, 2014)
Once the new mRNA is formed, transcription will occur. Transcription can be broken down into three main steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.
Once the mRNA is outside of the nucleus and inside the cytoplasm of the cell, two ribosomal subunits attach to the mRNA. Ribosomes can be found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Farabee, 2007). They can be thought of as protein making machines; they themselves are made up of protein and RNA. This linking step between the mRNA and ribosomes is called initiation.
The ribosome reads the nucleotides from the mRNA in groups of threes, known as a codon. It begins at a start codon, which is usually AUG. Transfer RNA, or tRNA, delivers the necessary amino acids in order to add the amino acids to the chain and create a protein. The codon of the mRNA is matched to three nucleotides on the tRNA, known as an anticodon. The anticodon is on one side of the tRNA while the amino acid that will be added to the chain is on the other. In elongation, the ribosome has three tRNA binding sites, known as the acceptor (A) site, the peptidyl (P) site, and the exit (E) site. The tRNA that has the chain of amino acids attached to it binds to the P site, and the new tRNA with an anticodon binds to the A site to be read and checked that it has the correct next anticodon. When the two tRNAs are next to each other, a bond forms between the amino group of one amino acid, and the acid group of the other. One of the tRNAs continues to the E site where it exits the ribosome and then goes back to the cytoplasm to find new amino acids. The protein grows until a stop codon is reached (Farabee, 2007).
The bonds between amino acids are called peptide bonds, and a strand of 10 or more amino acids is known as a polypeptide. Once the chain of amino acids is complete, termination takes place and the new protein is released from the ribosome (Teacher’s Pet, 2014), ready to perform one of the many functions of proteins which will be described in the next section.

5.3.1 Protein turnover
[
]
Protein turnover is defined as the continuous degradation and synthesis of proteins in our body. This process is important in human and animal cells because it allows them to grow and build the protein we need to survive. The organs in our body make use of this process to repair and build tissues and regulate metabolic pathways. When we obtain proteins from the food we eat, our body digests that food in our small intestines and breaks down the nutrient into smaller parts known as amino acids, which are essentially the building blocks of proteins (W H Freeman, 2002). When proteins are broken down into nitrogen containing amino acids, they are added into the amino acid pool, which is an accumulation of amino acids that are stored in the body for the future. The amount of protein we need in our body from our diet depends on nitrogen balance, which is the balance between the amounts of nitrogen digested versus the amount of nitrogen excreted. In normal cases, the rate of protein degradation equals the rate of protein synthesis. During an anabolic state, organisms or cells are growing therefore the rate of protein synthesis is higher than the rate of degradation. During a catabolic state, the rate of degradation is higher than that of protein synthesis (Doherty & Whitfield, 2011). This constant balancing of metabolic pathways allows our bodies to react to different cellular situations and stay in homeostasis.
There are a lot of factors that influence the rate of protein synthesis and degradation. In protein synthesis, the initiation of transcription as well as the activity of ribosomes has an effect. In protein degradation, the half-lives of proteins in a cell are not always constant and may vary (Cooper, 2000). In some cases degraded proteins are used as regulatory molecules, like in transcription, therefore they must be broken down rapidly. In other cases, proteins are degraded in response to certain signals so they can act as a mechanism in regulation depending on the intracellular environment (Cooper, 2000). In any case protein turnover must be swift in order to change their levels and react to external stimuli.
Protein turnover is a dynamic process that requires certain techniques in order for it to be measured. Some ways protein turnover can be measured include measuring the amount of RNA per DNA or protein, the state of aggregation of ribosomes (i.e. the polyribosome index), the abundance of mRNA for particular proteins, and the enzymatic activity of proteins such as proteases, ribonuclease, etc. (Smith & Rennie, 1996). However, the more common and efficient method of measuring protein turnover involves using a proteomic machine to set a precursor into a protein or amino acid so that quantifiable data can be obtain throughout the process (Doherty & Whitfield, 2011).
In the processes of protein synthesis and metabolism, amino acids can be used to form compounds other than protein in the body, such as neurotransmitters, glucose and adipose cells. But the most important and most common mechanisms of protein synthesis and metabolism occur when amino acids are broken down through deamination and then reconstructed to make nonessential amino acids and other types of proteins through transamination.
The process of deamination can be executed under aerobic or anaerobic conditions as it can be either oxidative or non-oxidative. Deamination occurs in all body tissues, but most notably is found in the liver. During this mechanism, an amine functional group is removed, forming an ammonia molecule that travels into the urea cycle (Ophardt, 2003). This functional group is replaced by a ketone group, thereby converting the amino acid into a keto acid, where the carbon skeleton can then be further broken down for energy, used to form fatty acids or glucose for energy storage, or can continue on to be synthesized into a nonessential amino acid (Diwan, 2008).
Transamination, the process of transferring an amino group to an alpha-keto acid from an amino acid, is essential for anabolic functions in humans, most importantly the synthesis of non-essential amino acids like aspartate and glutamate. There are 12 amino acids that are known as non-essential because they are synthesized in the body from other substances and don’t need to be supplied through the diet (“What is Transamination?”, 2015). The mechanism of this process begins when transaminase, the enzyme used to catalyze this reaction, binds the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate to a lysine residue of enzyme, forming an “aldimine”. Next, the amino group of a new substrate entering the active site displaces the amino group of lysine’s active site. A new bond is created with the alpha-amino group of the substrate, as the active site of lysine moves away. Rearrangement of electrons shifts the double bond to make a “ketamine”, then hydrolysis acts to release PMP, or pyridoxamine-5’-phosphate, as well as an alpha-keto acid. Finally, the PMP molecule combines with alpha-ketoglutarate in reverse of prior steps, and results in the transfer of an amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as glutamate release (Meister, 2006).
In looking closer at the interaction of amino acids, researchers have found that while most amino acids can undergo deamination, the process occurs primarily with glutamic acid due to the fact that this molecule serves as the end product of a plethora of transamination reactions (Ophardt, 2003). Commonly, the alpha-amino group of amino acids is transferred to alpha-ketoglutarate to make glutamate, which then undergoes oxidative deamination to yield the ammonium ion.  Transaminases catalyze this process, and generally guide alpha-amino groups from many different types of amino acids to alpha-ketoglutarate for the creation of a glutamate (Berg, 2002). Through this combination of the deamination and transamination of glutamic acid, which serves in recycling glutamic acid, other amino acids can be deaminated (Ophardt, 2003).

5.3.2 Amino acid pool
[
]
Definition:
The amino acid pool consists of all the amino acids available in the body for protein synthesis at a given time.  All these amino acids come from all different sources, and they get mixed up to form a general amino acid pool (Amino acid Pool). Liver is the main organ acting during this process, in which its main function is to regulate blood levels amino acids based on tissue needs. It also plays a role in converting excess of amino acids into carbohydrates when the body is lacking energy to sustain its metabolism. An adult body contains about a hundred grams of free amino acids, in which constitute the amino acid pool (Chaudhary, 2014).
During the process of protein turnover, cells are breaking down proteins and releasing amino acids. These released amino acids, as well as those supplied from our diet, make up the amino acid pool in our blood. Of the 20 common amino acids, nine are essential: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). Essential amino acids must be consumed in the diet because the body lacks the ability to generate these amino acids (Escott-Stump, 2008). There is a continuous demand for amino acids in the body so that protein homeostasis can be maintained. The amino acid pool is highly regulated, and must be supplied by 3 ways: exogenous proteins from the diet, the breakdown of tissue protein during the process of protein turnover, and de novo synthesis (Schultz, 2011). It's very important to have a varied diet in order to get all of these essential amino acids. Some foods contain a large amount of the essential amino acids, and some contain virtually none. The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAS) reflects the composition of amino acids found in food and the digestibility of these amino acids (Schaafsma, 2000). This score is important because it takes into account not only the composition of amino acids, but also how much of those amino acids the body actually digests and absorbs. Some food sources provide more essential amino acids than others, and the best way to get all the amino acids needed is to consume them naturally form food. Protein powders and amino acid supplements are often unnecessary in today's modern society because most people obtain proper protein and amino acid intake from their diet (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). Additionally, it is better for the body to breakdown these amino acids from food through the body's natural processes of protein metabolism. Excess amino acids in the body are converted to urea to be excreted.
Contribution of Amino acid Pool:
These mixtures of amino acids that are available at one time to the cell contribute to the amino acid pool, and it is produced from our dietary intake, turnover of proteins, synthesis of nonessential amino acids, and breakdown of tissues themselves. Proteins and amino acids are not stored inside our bodies, and that is why there is always a constant turnover of proteins (Protein Metabolism). During the turnover, some proteins are being synthesized while others are being degraded. The cell reaches a state of equilibrium when it takes as much amino acids as it loses. If the cell amino acid loss is greater, the cell wastes. If the cell amino acids gain is greater, the cell grows. This is why a balance of excretion and intake is of crucial importance in our bodies. Negative balance will produce tissue and protein destruction, but a positive balance will promote tissue and protein formation (Chaudhary, 2014). Their presence and availability also varies in the blood for certain proteins, for instance, plasma and liver protein’s duration in the blood is about 180 days while hormones and enzymes contain a half-life from minutes to hours in the blood. Hormones and enzymes are constantly recycled depending of the body needs and metabolism (Protein Metabolism). Amino acids catabolism produces great amounts of energy and ammonia, in which the latter compound is a highly toxic product for the body. In order to maintain low levels of toxicity inside body, ammonia is converted into urea in which is excreted in the urine by the kidneys. Urea can be observed as a “drain” in the amino acid pool because it is the compound that takes the excess of nitrogen, which is found and needed in amino acids synthesis (Protein Metabolism).
Deficiency:
It is difficult to understand the necessary amount of each amino acid in the amino acid pool because of the lack of valid indicators of adequacy (Institute of Medicine Committee on Military Nutrition Research, 1999). Deficiencies in certain amino acids or protein in general can cause diseases. To prevent disease it’s important to eat a well-balanced diet that supplies the essential amino acids and other sources of nitrogen to generate amino acids. When a person does not meet adequate protein and caloric intake, the body must degrade proteins to release amino acids to keep metabolic systems functioning properly (Cooper, 2000). It is extremely important to consume enough protein to generate all of the amino acids the body needs to function properly and maintain the balance of amino acids in the amino acid pool.

5.3.3 Nitrogen balance
[
]
Definition
Nitrogen balance is the relationship between the intake of nitrogen into the body (through protein rich foods) and the output of nitrogen excreted from the body (through urine and feces). The majority of the nitrogen in our bodies comes from protein. (Segen's Medical Dictionary, 2011).
Achieving nitrogen balance
In order to measure nitrogen balance and to determine nutritional competence, track the amount of protein that the body loses in the urine within twenty-four hours. To calculate this protein lost, measure the nitrogen products which are excreted through urine. On average, 0.5g/kg of protein from the diet is enough to ensure a zero nitrogen balance (Segen's Medical Dictionary, 2011). Our bodies require nitrogen in order to complete tissue protein synthesis and to produce nitrogen-containing compounds which are key in several vital functions; some of these important functions include hormones, immune competence, peroxidative defenses, and neurotransmitters (Tomé & Bos, 2000). Our bodies lose nitrogen in several ways, also. Mainly, nitrogen is lost by means of urea, creatinine, and ammonia in the urine; in addition, nitrogen is lost in fecal matter and other miscellaneous losses (Tomé & Bos, 2000).
Nitrogen balance
When the intake of nitrogen through the diet is the same as the output of nitrogen through urine and feces, total body protein does not change; the body is at nitrogen equilibrium/balance which is the normal state in a healthy adult. When intake in nitrogen is greater than the output of nitrogen, total body protein increases; people who experience a positive nitrogen balance are those who are pregnant, growing, or recovering from the body’s protein loss from undernutrition or trauma. When intake of nitrogen is less than the output of nitrogen, total body protein endures a net loss; the body is at a negative nitrogen balance which is abnormal and unhealthy. A negative nitrogen balance is the body’s response to infection, trauma, or the inadequate intake of nutrients to aid in replacing tissue proteins which are turning over (Bender, 2006).
On average, healthy adults consume 80 grams of protein in one day, and the body intakes 70 more grams of protein through digestive enzymes in the gut, intestinal enzymes, and shed intestinal cells. Our bodies hydrolyze the majority of this protein to dipeptides and amino acids, and the dipeptides are then hydrolyzed. The body loses on average ten grams of protein each day through fecal matter; protein that is lost through feces is often indigestible protein from the diet, bacterial protein, or mucin (mucus’s main protein which resists hydrolysis from enzymes). Proteins that are absorbed are utilized for protein synthesis which occurs in recovering adults and growing children. Their bodies must synthesize proteins in order to replace the proteins that are turning over. From the amino acid pool, some of the amino acids are reused, but most are deaminated; amino acids that are newly absorbed in excess for protein synthesis use are also deaminated. The carbon skeletons that remain are utilized for gluconeogenesis, metabolic fuels, or fatty acid synthesis. The amino groups from the amino acids form urea which is the primary nitrogen-containing compound which we excrete through urine (Bender, 2006).

5.4 Functions: Proteins
[
]
Protein is an important aspect of both the function and maintenance of the human body. Without protein, the muscles, bones and even skin would not be able to function correctly. One unique aspect of protein is that the body has no way to store it for future use, as it can store carbohydrates and fats. Many people use this as an excuse to overconsume protein through everything from protein shakes to specialized protein bars. Unfortunately, too much protein can actually do more harm to the body than good.  This excess protein can be converted to fat and then stored in the body.  Just like any other macronutrient, protein in excess is not good.

5.4.1 Cell and tissue synthesis
[
]
It is understood that proteins are very versatile. They have the ability to grow, repair, and replace tissue.
Proteins are known as the building blocks of the body, and are the main structural component of all the body's cells. For example, in the process of building bone, the protein generates a matrix in collagen.
Matrix: the basic substance that gives for to a developing structure.
Collagen: the structural protein that form the foundations of  bone and teeth.
Then, the proteins add minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and fluoride, that give the bone it's strength.
The protein collagen plays a very important role superficially and deep to the skin.  When you get a scar after a cut or scratch, that is the college fibers that knit the separate parts of torn tissue together.  Also, collagen is vital to the circulatory system. It provides the materials of ligaments and tendons and the strength between artery walls that allows them to be flexible enough while blood pumps through them; this is because of collagen's elasticity.
There is another fibrous protein, called keratin, that is found all throughout the body, but mostly in the epidermis. A specific type of keratin filament is abundant in the skin, in epithelial tissue, which makes the skin tough and creates a natural water barrier. As the epithelial cells in the epidermis die, cells from the next layer (there are 5 layers within the epidermis) take their place. The protein that make up the keratinocytes help replace damaged or dead cells that are found in the skin.

5.4.2 Enzymes
[
]
Enzym [greek: enzym; en = in; zume = sourdough, yeast; enzym = in sourdough).
The old name for enzyme is 'ferment'.
Except for a small group of RNA molecules, enzymes are proteins that operate as a biological catalyst, i.e. an accelerator of (bio)chemical processes that occur in living organisms.
( RNA: ribonucleic acid )
History
About 10000 BC: Fermentation; the proces that resulted in the discovery of enzymes.
2000 BC: Egyptians and Sumarians developed fermentation for the use in brewing, bread baking and the manufacturing of cheese.
800 BC: the stomachs of kalves and the enzyme chymosine were used for the manufacturing of cheese.
Middle ages: alchemists identify alcohol as a product of fermentation.
Alcoholic fermentation is undeniably the oldest known enzyme reaction. These and other phenomena where until 1857 thought to be spontaneous reactions.
In 1857 concluded the French chemist Louis Pasteur that alcoholice fermentation is catalysed by 'ferments' and will only take place in the presence of living cells.
Subsequently discovered the German chemist Eduard Buchner in 1897 that a cellfree extract of yeast can cause alcoholic fermentation.
The old puzzle was solved; the yeast cells produce the enzym that controls the fermentation.
In 1877, German physiologist Wilhelm Kühne (1837–1900) first used the term enzyme.
Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions and allow them to occur more efficiently than if the reactants, also called substrates, had come together by chance. Though the enzyme participates in the chemical reaction, it always comes away unchanged and does not affect the chemical equilibrium.  Most enzymes in biological systems are proteins, though some RNA molecules do also participate in catalysis.
The amino acid side chains are what give each protein enzyme its specific catalytic properties. The different types of amino acid side chains are as follows:
Hydrophobic amino acids include: Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, Pro, Ile, Phe, Tyr, and Trp.
Polar, uncharged amino acids include:  Ser, Thr, Cys, Asn, and Gln.
Positively-charged, polar amino acids include: Lys, Arg, and His.
Negatively-charged, polar amino acids include: Asp and Glu.
The properties of these groups can speed up reactions by positioning the substrate in the optimal conformation for a reaction to occur, such as when a hydrophobic substrate situates itself into a hydrophobic “pocket” of amino acids in the enzyme active site. Some of the side chains of the polar amino acids can also participate in nucleophilic reactions and form hydrogen bonds with the substrates, which aids in catalysis. In addition to the side chains, the amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) termini of the proteins can assist in these reactions. Only globular proteins, which are soluble in water, can act as enzymes in biological systems. In these proteins, the hydrophobic amino acids are clustered on the inside of the folded protein, while the hydrophilic, polar amino acids are on the outside. This property gives them their solubility.
There are six main classes of enzymes. These classes are based on how the enzyme functions in catalysis. The first class, oxidoreductases, catalyzes the movement of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and electrons between substrates. The second class, transferases, transfers chemical groups, such as a methyl group, between substrates. The third group, hydrolases, catalyzes the splitting of a substrate using water.  The fourth type, lyases, catalyzes the removal of groups from substrates without using water. These enzymes often leave behind double bonds. The fifth class, isomerases, catalyzes the rearrangement of atoms within the substrate. For example, a major enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, triose phosphate isomerase, catalyzes the conversion of the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The last class of enzymes, ligases, catalyzes the synthesis of new chemical bonds. These enzymes use the energy of nucleotide triphosphates, such as ATP, to drive the reaction forward.
Enzymes of all types are involved in the metabolism of the major macromolecules during and after digestion. Protein enzymes are involved in the regulation of the major metabolic pathways, as well. These enzymes often act through phosphorylation by protein kinases and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. The whole system of activation or deactivation is called an enzyme cascade.
An example of an enzyme cascade is the system that activates and deactivates the breakdown of carbohydrates.  These cascades are started when a hormonal messenger, such as glucagon or insulin, bind to a receptor protein on the outside of the cell. In the case of glucagon, a chain of reactions is initiated that eventually end in the activation of protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates the hydroxyl groups of amino acids in enzymes that will eventually lead to an increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and decrease in glycogenesis and glycolysis. The binding of insulin has the opposite effect. It stimulates the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on its receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates a protein phosphatase that will dephosphorylate other enzymes. The end result is an increase of glycolysis and glycogen breakdown and decrease in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  The metabolism of other macromolecules is mediated in a similar way. In this way, enzymes are involved in nearly every step of metabolism.
In this way, the unique properties of the amino acids in proteins affect how an enzyme functions in catalysis. Without enzymes, chemical reactions in biological systems would occur too slowly for life to exist. Therefore, enzymes have a very important role in life.

5.4.3 Hormones
[
]
Hormone literally means to urge on. Hormones are your body's chemical messengers. They travel in your bloodstream to tissues or organs.
Only a small amount of hormone is required to alter cell metabolism. It is essentially a chemical messenger that transports a signal from one cell to another. The hormone binds to the receptor protein, resulting in the activation of a signal transduction mechanism that ultimately leads to cell type-specific responses.
Hormones can be divided up on the basis of their chemical structure into 5 groups:
Those derived directly from the amino acid tyrosine, including: thyroxine, triiodothyronine,
adrenaline and noradrenaline
Those made up of short chains of amino acids, including: adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, gastrin, glucagon and calcitonin.
Those made up of long chains of amino acids, including: insulin, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), cholecystokinin (CCK)and secretin
Those made up of proteins linked with glucose molecules forming glycoproteins, including: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, luteinising hormone (LH)
Those derived from cholesterol thus forming lipid soluble steroid hormones, including: oestrogens, progesterones, testosterone, androstenedione, aldosterone and cortisol.
So, the hormones have many function:
Alter plasma membrane permeability by opening or closing gated ion channels
Stimulate the synthesis of proteins, more specifically enzymes
Activate or deactivate enzymes that are already made
Induce secretory activity
Stimulate cell division
5.4.4 Fluid balance
[
]
Fluid balance is maintaining the correct amount of fluid in the body. It is the continuance of the fluid input and output of the body.
Fluid balance can alter with disease and illness.
Body fluids are regulated by fluid intake, hormonal controls, and fluid output.
5 KEY POINTS
Fluid balance is the balance of the input and output of fluids in the body to allow metabolic processes to function
To assess fluid balance, nurses need to know about fluid compartments in the body and how fluid moves between these compartments
Dehydration is defined as a 1% or greater loss of body mass as a result of fluid loss. Symptoms include impaired cognitive function, headaches, fatigue and dry skin. Severe dehydration can lead to hypovolaemic shock, organ failure and death
The three elements to assessing fluid balance and hydration status are: clinical assessment, body weight and urine output; review of fluid balance charts; and review of blood chemistry
Fluid balance recording is often inadequate or inaccurate often because of staff shortages, lack of training or lack of time
5.4.5 Acid-base regulation
[
]
What's normal?
Proteins also act as acid-base regulators. Since proteins have negative charges on their surface they attract the positive charge of hydrogen ions. By accepting and releasing hydrogen ions, proteins act as buffers, maintaining the acid-base balance of the blood and body fluids (A.C.).A normal range for arterial pH is 7.35 to 7.45. Acidosis is a pH less than 7.35; alkalosis is a pH greater than 7.45. Because pH is measured in terms of hydrogen (H+) ion concentration, an increase in H+ ion concentration decreases pH and vice versa.
Changes in H+ ion concentration can be stabilized through several buffering systems: bicarbonate-carbonic acid, proteins, hemoglobin, and phosphates.
Acidosis, therefore, can be described as a physiologic condition caused by the body's inability to buffer excess H+ ions.
Acid-base equilibrium is closely tied to fluid and electrolyte balance, and disturbances in one of these systems often affect another. Fluid metabolism is discussed in Fluid Metabolism, and electrolytes are discussed in Electrolyte Disorders.
Thus, the body has three compensatory mechanisms to handle changes in serum
pH:
Physiologic buffers,  consisting of a weak acid (which can easily be broken down) and its base salt or of a weak base and its acid salt.
Pulmonary compensation, in which changes in ventilation work to change the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and drive the pH toward the normal range.
Renal compensation, which kicks in when the other mechanisms have been ineffective, generally after about 6 hours of sustained acidosis or alkalosis.
Alkalosis results from a deficiency in H+ ion concentration. Acidemia and alkalemia refer to the process of acidosis or alkalosis, respectively, occurring in arterial blood.
5.4.6 Transporters
[
]
Transport proteins arehttp://www.minahealth.com/what_are_transport_proteins.htm:
proteins within the membranes of cells that transport substances such as molecules and ions across the membrane or within the cell, or can be involved in vesicular transpor
in blood plasma bind and carry specific molecules or ions from one organ to another.
Hemoglobin of erythrocytes binds oxygen as the blood passes through the lungs.
Other kinds of transport proteins are present in the plasma membranes and intracellular membranes of all organisms; these are adapted to bind glucose, amino acids, or other substances and transport them across the membrane.
Here are some functions of transporters:
- hemoglobin: carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells
- Lipoproteins: transport lipids around the body.
In living beings transport phenomena are essential, either to carry a hydrophobic molecule through an aqueous medium (transport of oxygen or lipid through the blood) or to transport molecules across barriers polar hydrophobic (transport across plasma membrane). Carriers and channels are always biological proteins.
Membrane proteins, such as channels and pumps, are important for the transport of some compounds across the cell membrane. Adsorbed nutrients must cross four barriers to reach the bloodstream:
The mucus layer, a diffusion barrier which is rather thin in the small intestine.
The enterocyte apical membrane- a lipid bilayer, which requires transport proteins for water- soluble molecules
The enterocyte- a metabolic barrier which may metabolise the nutrient.
The basolateral membrane- a lipid bilayer which again requires  transport proteins for water- soluble molecules.
In addition to transport proteins, absorption is enhanced by metabolic compartmentation or zonation within the enterocyte, which prevents excessive metabolism (e.g. only 10% of absorbed glucose).
The classification of transmembrane molecular transporters
has been developed and recently approved by the transport panel of the nomenclature committee of the
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
. This system is hared on (i) transporter class and subclass (mode of transport and energy coupling mechanism), (ii) protein phylogenetic family and subfamily and (iii) substrate specificity. Almost all of the more than, 250 identified families of transporters include members that function exclusively in transport. Channels (115 families), secondary active transporters (uniporters, symporters and antiporters) (78 families), primary active transporters (23 families), group translocators (6 families), and transport proteins of ill-defined function or of unknown mechanism (51 families) constitute distinct categories.
Although different transporters carry very different substrates, they share many common structural features. They have regions of hydrophobic amino acids that can fold into helices which, when grouped together like the staves of a barrel, span the membrane and form a ‘pore’ through which substrates can be transported. Parts of the protein (bearing a sugar polymer) are outside the membrane and can act as a signaling receptor to allow other compounds to control the rate of transport of the main substrate.
Transport may be either passive, allowing ten transported nutrient to come to equilibrium across the membrane, or active, permitting a higher concentration to be achieved on one side of the membrane than the other.
Osmosis
[
]
Proteins are not involved. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable (or differentially permeable or selectively permeable) membrane. The presence of a solute decreases the water potential of a substance. Thus there is more water per unit of volume in a glass of fresh-water than there is in an equivalent volume of sea-water. In a cell, which has so many organelles and other large molecules, the water flow is generally into the cell.
Water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen are among the few simple molecules that can cross the cell membrane by diffusion (or a type of diffusion known as osmosis.
The effect of this water movement is to dilute the area of higher concentration. Reverse osmosis is the passage of water from a more concentrated to a less concentrated solution through a semi-permeable membrane by the application of pressure.
Hypertonic solutions are those in which more solute (and hence lower water potential) is present. Hypotonic solutions are those with less solute (again read as higher water potential). Isotonic solutions have equal (iso-) concentrations of substances.
One of the major functions of blood in animals is the maintain an isotonic internal environment. This eliminates the problems associated with water loss or excess water gain in or out of cells. Again we return to homeostasis.
Passive diffusion
[
]
Diffusion is one principle method of movement of substances within cells, as well as the method for essential small molecules to cross the cell membrane. Passive diffusion or transport driven by a difference in concentration of the element between the two sides of the membrane and the mucosa. Passive transport does not require energy and moves with a concentration gradient. Transmembrane movement of ions occurs through pores or channels within the membrane and is an
energy-independent process
. Proteins are not involved in all types of passive transport of nutrients. A significant amount of passive transport across the intestinal mucosa may occur through a paracellular pathway, or the transport between cells aross intercellular right junctions.
Some examples of how is the movement of nutrients from an area of higher concentration (with the concentration gradient) to an area of lower concentration without the help of a protein (passive transport) are: ethanol absorbtion into the enterocyte; 75% of Vitamin B6 from foods; Thiamin uptake and absorption is believed to be an efficient process that is passive when thiamin intake is high and active when thiamin intakes are low.
Facilited diffusion
[
]
Facilitated diffusion is the transfer of an element across the membrane by carrier proteins embedded in the membrane. Facilitated transport resembles simple diffusion because it is
not energy dependent
and is driven by a difference in the ion concentration between two sides of a membrane. Facilitated transport occurs much more rapidly than simple diffusion and is saturable because of a finite number of carrier proteins.
These comprise
facilitated transporters and ion channels
, which permit the transfers of a solute across the membrane in either direction. Transport therefore takes place down a concentration gradient (so-called ‘downhill transport’). Net accumulation of the transported material in the cell can occur as a result of either onward metabolism to a compound that does not cross the membrane (e.g. vitamin B6 is accumulated intracellulary by phosphorylation to pyridoxal phosphate) or by binding to cytosolic proteins (e.g. ferritin, which binds iron).
The definition of a ’’’channel’’’ (or a pore) is that of a protein structure that facilitates the translocation of molecules or ions across the membrane through the creation of a central aqueous channel in the protein. This central channel facilitates diffusion in both directions dependent upon the direction of the concentration gradient. Channel proteins do not bind or sequester the molecule or ion that is moving through the channel. Specificity of channels for ions or molecules is a function of the size and charge of the substance. The flow of molecules through a channel can be regulated by various mechanisms that result in opening or closing of the passageway.
So, a transport protein may be linked to another regulatory protein that can chaperone the transporter into the membrane and thus modulate transport capacity.
Membrane channels are of
three distinct types'
. The α-type channels are homo- or hetero-oligomeric structures that in the latter case consist of several dissimilar proteins. This class of channel protein has between 2 and 22 transmembrane α-helical domains which explain the derivation of their class. Molecules move through α-type channels down their concentration gradients and thus require no input of metabolic energy. Some channels of this class are highly specific with respect to the molecule translocated across the membrane while others are not. In addition, there may be differences from tissue to tissue in the channel used to transport the same molecule. As an example, there are over 15 different K+-specific voltage-regulated channels in humans.
The transport of molecules through α-type channels occurs by several different mechanisms. These mechanisms include changes in membrane potential (termed voltage-regulated or voltage-gated), phosphorylation of the channel protein, intracellular Ca2+, G-proteins, and organic modulators.
Aquaporins
Aquaporins(AQP) are a family of α-type channels responsible for the transport of water across membranes. At least 11 aquaporin proteins have been identified in mammals with 10 known in humans (termed AQP0 through AQP9). A related family of proteins is called the aquaglyceroporins which are involved in water transport as well as the transport of other small molecules. AQP9 is the human aquaglyceroporin. The aquaporins assemble in the membrane as homotetramers with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane α-helical domains forming the distinct water pore. Probably the most significant location of aquaporin expression is in the kidney. The proximal tubule expresses AQP1, AQP7, and AQP8, while the collecting ducts express AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP6, and AQP8. Loss of function of the renal aquaporins is associated with several disease states. Reduced expression of AQP2 is associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), acquired hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia.
The β-barrel channels (also called porins) are so named because they have a transmembrane domain that consists of β-strands forming a β-barrel structure. Porins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria. The mitochondrial porins are voltage-gated anion channels that are involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis. The pore-forming toxins represent the third class of membrane channels. Although this is a large class of proteins first identified in bacteria, there are a few proteins of this class expressed in mammalian cells. The defensins are a family of small cysteine-rich antibiotic proteins that are pore-forming channels found in epithelial and hematopoietic cells. The defensins are involved in host defense against microbes (hence the derivation of their name) and may be involved in endocrine regulation during infection.
Examples of Passive Transport in Human Nutrition
[
]
Carbohydrates
Fructose and sugar alcohols are carried by passive transporters, while glucose and galactose are taken up by the same active (sodium-linked) transporter. This means that only a proportion of fructose and sugar alcohols can be absorbed, and after a large dose much may remain in the lumen, leading to osmotic diarrhea.
Water and electrolytes
It is not known how water is transported, several hypotheses have been proposed. Water absorption is a passive process by which water passes across paracellular and transcellular pathways in response to osmotic gradients created by transcellular absorption of sodium and other solutes.
Simple osmosis may account for some water uptake, but the osmolality difference is only 3-30 mosmol/kg, and this would mean that enterocytes replaced their entire fluid volume evety few seconds. While some water is co-transporter itself, enterocytes do not have enough transporters to account for all the water absorbed. Specific water transporters (aquaporins) occur in the cells of secretoty epithelia, and studies in gene knockout nice suggest they may be quantitatively the most important factor in water absorption. The colon acts as an organ of water and electrolyte salvage, but its capacity is limited. Rapid infusion of 500 ml or more of water into the colon will provoke diarrhea through reflex defecation and this is the basis of rectally administered enemas.
Sugar alcohols, used as sweeteners, such as xylitol, lactitol and sorbitol, are poorly absorbed and will enter the colon with sufficient water to maintain luminal isotonicity before fermentation and the absorption of SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), water and Na+. If the colonic fermentation capacity is exceeded then osmotic diarrhea ensues because the excess water cannot be absorbed. Most minerals are absorbed by carrier-mediated diffusion (not passive).
Vitamins
The water-soluble vitamins are absorbed by specific transport proteins. An example of passive transport of water-soluble vitamins are the  phosphorylated derivatives of vitamins B1,B2, and B6 are dephosphorylated in the intestinal lumen, which are absorbed by facilitated  transporters, then trapped inside the cells by rephosphorylation. Vitamin B12 is absorbed bound to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein that is secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa.
Active Transport
[
]
Active transport
Synopsis:
The difference between passive and active transport whether energy is required and whether they move with or against a concentration gradient. Passive transport does not require energy and moves with a concentration gradient. Active transport requires energy to move against the concentration gradient.
The energy for active uptake/transport is provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency in the body. ATP stores energy in its high-energy phosphate bonds.
Active transport and the role of carrier proteins is a lot like an enzyme substrate reaction. Each type of carrier protein has at least one binding site for its specific substrate or solute. The carrier protein brings the solute across the lipid bilayer of a membrane expose the solute-binding site first on one side of the membrane and then on the other. Competitive inhibitors or non competitive inhibitors can both interrupt and block the binding of a solute, just like what happens with enzymes. Competitive inhibitors compete for the same binding site while noncompetitive inhibitors bind elsewhere indirectly alter the shape of the carrier protein, hindering its ability to have it's specific substrate bind to it.
The process of active transport is done in three ways:
1. Coupled carriers couple the uphill transport of one solute across the membrane to the downhill transport of another.
Energy is provided by ATP hydrolysis
2.ATP-driven pumps couple uphill transport to the hydrolysis of ATP.
By a downhill flow of another solute (such as Na+ or H+) that has released energy
3. Light-driven pumps, which are found mainly in bacterial cells, couple uphill transport to an input of energy from light.

5.4.7 Antibodies
[
]
Proteins are involved in defense, specifically against foreign invaders. Antibodies are the specialized proteins that do this job, they defend the body against antigens and are used by the immune system to protect the body against bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances (A.C.).  Antibodies are large Y-shaped proteins. They are recruited by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.
How do Antibodies Work?
Antibodies circulate in the blood stream and can appear anywhere throughout the body. If circulating antibodies come in contact with the target or antigen they were generated to fight, then the antibodies bind to the target. Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may recruit macrophages to destroy the foreign substance.
As functions:
File:Antibody funtion
http://www.nwcreation.net/presentations/recombination/img031.GIF
Types of Antibody:
Type:
1. IGG:
two identical heavy chainsand two identical light chains arranged in a Y-shape typical of antibody monomers.  (also called "gamma globulin") is the most abundant antibody in the human immune system. It is found in blood and tissue liquids. IgG is the only antibody capable of crossing the placenta to provide immune protection to a developing fetus. IgG antibodies appear about one month after an infection, so their presence indicates a mature antibody response to a foreign pathogen.
2. IGM: hich is found mainly in the blood and lymph fluid, is the first to be made by the body to fight a new infection.
3. IGA: Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the major class of antibody present in the mucosal secretions of most mammals, represents a key first line of defence against invasion by inhaled and ingested pathogens at the vulnerable mucosal surfaces.  Exist 2 specie IgA1 and IgA2:
IgA1 is the predominant IgA subclass found in serum. Most lymphoid tissues have a predominance of IgA-producing cells.
In IgA2, the heavy and light chains are not linked with disulfide, but with noncovalent bonds. In secretory lymphoid tissues (e.g., gut-associated lymphoid tissue, or GALT), the share of IgA2 production is larger than in the non-secretory lymphoid organs (e.g. spleen, peripheral lymph nodes).
4.IGE: IgE primes the IgE-mediated allergic response by binding to Fc receptors found on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Fc receptors are also found on eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets in humans.
5.IGD:
one of the five classes of antibodies produced by the body. It is found in small amounts in serum tissue. Although its precise function is not known, IgD increases in quantity during allergic reactions to milk, insulin, penicillin, and various toxins. The normal concentration of IgD in serum is 0.5 to 3 mg/dL
5.4.8 Energy and Glucose
[
]
The energy in glucose is stored in the covalent bonds between the molecules, and most importantly, in the hydrogen electrons. The hydrogen electrons were boosted to a "higher energy level" in the process of photosynthesis (which is transfered by plants from sunlight) during the photosystem I in plants. These hydrogen electrons will than pass through the electron transport chain during aerobic cellular respiration, and the hydrogen ions become stable.]
1.8   5.4.8 Protein Function- Energy and Glucose
In the instance of severe carbohydrate insufficiency, protein can be diverted from its usual function to provide the brain and nervous system with energy in the form of glucose. (Berg, Tymoczko, & Stryer, 2002). However, protein yields significantly less energy than carbohydrates and lipids (4 kcal/gram to 9 kcal/gram), and using protein as fuel sacrifices its other unique functions. Restricting carbohydrates and therefore relying on protein as a primary energy source can be a risky dietary choice if not regulated by a physician.
Proteins are incorporated into energy pathways as their building block molecules- amino acids. Prior to metabolism, the amino group (NH2) must be removed from the backbone carbon skeleton of the amino acid through a process called deamination. The nitrogen containing amino group is synthesized with carbon dioxide in the liver to form urea, which is sent to the kidneys before excretion through the liver (Schutz, 2011). The carbon skeleton is retained for entry into the energy pathways. Glucogenic amino acids are converted to pyruvate, which can either form Acetyl CoA and enter the TCA cycle, or form glucose. Ketogenic amino acids are converted directly to Acetyl CoA and therefore cannot form glucose. Both glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids can provide the body with energy or form body fat through the TCA cycle, but only glucogenic amino acids can provide the body with additional glucose.

5.4.9 Protein Regulation
[
]
Proteins are responsible for an astounding number of functions in the cell from DNA replication to helping produce proteins themselves. Without proteins, we would be unable to survive. With proteins being such an important aspect of our biology, nature is sure to have made several checks and balances so that they are able to function correctly and prevent them from damaging our cells. This section will provide a basic overview one of the protein regulation mechanisms; protein inhibition.
Many of the pharmaceutical medications that we use to treat various illnesses or symptoms involve using protein inhibition. Inhibition works to slow down, stop, or speed up the activity of a certain enzyme and thus the desired effect can be made. For example, Penicillin acts by inhibiting and blocking the enzyme some bacteria use to make their cell walls and without a cell wall the bacteria cannot survive (Berg et. al, 2002). There are a few different types of inhibition including competitive, noncompetitive/allosteric, and feedback inhibition.
Competitive Inhibition:
Each enzyme has its own active site where it binds to a given reactant, or substrate. These substrates can vary from other proteins to water molecules and much more depending on what the enzyme’s specific role in the cell is. An active site will only bind substrates that perfectly fit into its shape. Competitive inhibition surrounds the binding of the active site of a given enzyme. A competitive inhibitor will compete with a given reactant for the chance to bind to an enzyme’s active site. Think of an enzyme with a circular shaped active site, which binds to its given circular shaped reactant normally in a given cell. If a competitive inhibitor is added to this cell that is also circular shaped, the reactant and the inhibitor will fight their spot in the enzyme’s active site and thus decrease the rate of the reaction of a given enzyme. How well a competitive inhibitor works is dependent on its binding affinity (Stretlow et. al, 2012), a concept that will not be explored in this section.
Noncompetitive/Allosteric Inhibition:
Several enzymes have an alternate site other than their active site, called an allosteric site. Some small molecules act as inhibitors by being able to bind to these allosteric sites which can therefore change the active site of the enzyme. Through this mechanism, allosteric inhibitors do not directly compete with the active site and can change the shape of active site, preventing the normal substrate from binding to the active side.
Feedback Inhibition:
Feedback inhibition is a specific type of allosteric inhibition where the product of a series of enzymatic reactions allosterically inhibits the first enzyme in the series to effect the sequence of reactions. This type of inhibition can be divided into positive or negative feedback, where the reaction product will either increase or decrease the amount of product produced. An example of this is the feedback inhibition of Angiotensin on Renin (Antonipillai et. al, 1998) which is a topic we covered in class and involves positive feedback.

5.4.10 Other Functions
[
]
Proteins also take part in some background roles like blood clotting and vision. When injured a sequence of events occurs that leads to the production of fibrin, a stringy, insoluble mass of protein fibers that forms a solid clot from liquid blood. After clotting occurs, protein collagen forms to create a scar that replaces the clot and heals the wound.

Protein Functions
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Dietary intake
Proteins and Health
5.5 Dietary Intake:PROTEIN
[
]
Dietary Intake: Protein
AMDR/DRI VALUES
Protein is needed in the body because it repairs body tissue, regulates hormones and enzymes, and helps antibodies function so that it can fight infection. Proteins are made up of amino acids, which give structure to muscles and tissue. Therefore, the intake of protein is essential for the body to function. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for proteins for adults is 10 to 35 percent. The amount of protein a person is supposed to consume per day is known as the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). For protein, the DRI is 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight or .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. An average man should consume about 56 grams of protein per day, and an average woman should consume about 46 grams per day. The average man weighs more than the average woman; therefore, men should eat more protein. For example, if a woman weighs 135 pounds, the DRI for protein would be 48.988 grams of protein. We can calculate this by using the weight in kilograms and multiplying it by 0.8. 135 pounds equals 61.235 kilograms; therefore, you can multiply 61.235 by .8, which will equal 48.988 grams. (Protein in the Vegan Diet) Pregnant women obviously need more protein. Women should average 71 grams if they are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Vegetarian Source of Protein
[
]
Vegetarians may have a hard time eating enough protein. This is because meat, fish, eggs, and dairy are usually the main sources of protein. The problem with meat is that it is most likely high in cholesterol. “Meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat.” (Choose MyPlate, 2015) If it isn’t lean or low-fat, it can be high in cholesterol and also make you gain weight.  This is bad because it can lead to coronary heart disease, which can result in a heart attack. If you are a vegetarian, foods that you may wish to consume include green peas, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, dried beans, peanut butter, and almonds. This may be needed for people that don’t eat meat. Vegans and Vegetarians on average eat less protein than people who eat meat. (Protein in the Vegan Diet) People that don’t eat enough protein can also take protein supplements. The majority of people don’t need these supplements. However, some athletes who need to gain weight may take them. Also, it may be essential for bodybuilders to take these supplements. Some bodybuilders wake themselves up so that they can eat protein.
How Protein Affects the Body
[
]
Protein can make you lose weight. This is because protein can make people feel extremely full so they would consume fewer calories throughout the day. Protein intake can also help you gain muscle. This is because in order to gain muscle, one person must gain more muscle protein than the muscle that is being broken down after a workout. For example after lifting weights, many people will consume a protein shake in order to repair muscles so that the muscle can get bigger. However some athletes believe they should be eating protein throughout the time. Therefore, they might eat protein an hour after workout instead of right away.
To gain muscle, the body needs to synthesize more muscle protein than it breaks down. Animal proteins support muscle adaptations with weight or other exercise training more easily compared to plant based proteins since proteins from animals contain more complete amino acids. To increase muscle mass for an individual who regularly lifts weights, it is recommended that they intake a range of 1.2-1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. A common but false recommendation is to get a gram of protein per pound of body weight. This much protein intake has no benefit to gaining muscle mass and may actually cause negative consequences. No more than 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body is necessary to build muscle.

5.5.1 Excess
[
]
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for an average person is 0.8g/kg, but some groups may need a higher amount (such as children, women during pregnancy and lactation, or athletes). An upper level has been set at 30% of the total calorie intake.
There are three main risks associated with high protein diets:
dehydration
,
kidney damage
and
bone damage
.
-
Dehydration
occurs by the need to excrete large amounts of urea and other nitrogenous wastes from protein catabolism. It can be prevented by increasing fluid consumption.
-
Kidney damage
has been proved in people with prior renal problems. Kidneys would not be able to eliminate all the waste products of protein metabolism. However, no studies have shown significant proof of this link in healthy individuals.
-
Bone damage
has been a controversial topic over the last years. Some studies claim catabolic effect and others claim anabolic effect. Those that claim catabolic effect (lose of bone density) blame the acids generated by the oxidation of aminoacids. These acids would destabilize the acid-base balance. In order to excrete the excess acid load, the bone will release calcium, magnesium and other compounds to serve as the buffers. Studies claiming anabolic effect point at the intake of fruits, vegetables and dietary calcium to balance out the excess of acid.  [3-7]
Proteins serve an immense role such as being enzymes, aiding in cell structure, hormonal function, and their role in being transport carriers. The human body is nothing without proteins (Dietary Reference Intakes: Macronutrients, 2005). There is rising concern about the media, popular diet books, and health professionals promoting high protein diets without enough scientific data. These sources are promoting high levels of protein intake in order to manage weight and increase muscle synthesis (Bilsborough & Mann, 2006). Although the importance of protein can be clearly seen, excess protein intake can lead to major problems such reduced liver and brain function, weight gain, and high cholesterol.
Excess protein has the potential of reducing liver and brain function due to the extra production of ammonia by the human body. Ammonia is a toxin produced by the liver, and in normal levels, it is effectively removed from the body by the urinary system. During excess protein intake, overproduction of ammonia results, and this causes the liver to be overworked. This then leads to toxin buildup in both the liver and the bloodstream. This specific issue can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, and this condition is associated with decline in brain in nervous system function (Appleby & Media, 2015).
Weight gain is another problem associated with excess protein intake. The human body is only able to use up a certain amount protein daily; therefore, the excess protein is stored as fat. Each gram of protein has 4 calories, and these extra calories quickly add up by the end of the week if additional protein is continuously being eaten (Appleby & Media, 2015).
Another problem associated with high levels of protein intake is high cholesterol. High cholesterol is mainly correlated with high protein foods, such as from animal products, which contain ample amounts of cholesterol. High cholesterol leads to hardened arteries, which may in turn lead to severe health problems like heart attack and stroke. According to the guidelines set out by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, cholesterol intake should not be more than 200 milligrams per day. Since protein-rich animal products contain high levels cholesterol, it is important to eat in moderation in order to stay within guideline range (Appleby & Media, 2015).
The recommended plan for protein intake laid out by the Institute of Medicine, is that 10-15 percent of the calories taken in daily should be high rich protein. Women need about 46 grams of protein daily, while men need about 56 grams of protein daily. Specifically, people who partake in high levels of physical activity need more protein daily as opposed to others; however, this must be checked with a medical doctor before increasing protein intake (Appleby & Media, 2015).
While protein can slow digestion and help one feel full, too much protein is a dangerous thing. For an 80-kilogram person, the liver can’t metabolize much more than 221–301 grams of protein per day; this is about 2.76-3.76 grams of protein per kilogram. Too much protein consumption can result in ammonia and urea buildup in the bloodstream, which is toxic to the brain. The liver usually converts amino acids from protein into urea to be removed by the kidneys but when too much protein is consumed, the liver will start to slow down and fail to convert ammonia into urea. High protein consumption coupled with very low fat and carb intake can lead to a form of protein poisoning known as rabbit starvation. If needed, the human body can only utilize about 1000 calories from protein as energy a day. This is because the liver is only capable of producing about 250 grams of glucose from protein and any more than this is useless and dangerous. Attempting to consume a normal 2000-calorie based diet on mostly protein will lead to rabbit starvation. The name comes from the fact that humans cannot live on a diet of only rabbit meat because it is too lean with only about 8% fat.

5.5.2 Deficiency
[
]
In the United States, protein deficiencies are not as common as protein excess is. This is because almost all of our food has a significant amount of protein in it. Protein-rich foods provide us with essential amino acids that are needed for daily function. Foods that supply us with essential amino acids include, but are not limited to, meat, dairy products, and eggs. (Tuso, Ismail, Ha, Bartolotto, 2013)
Essential amino acids also come from various combinations of plant-based foods such as quinoa. (Tuso, Ismail, Ha, Bartolotto, 2013) While protein deficiency is not a rampant issue within the United States, it can be detrimental for those who suffer from it. Those who suffer from protein deficiencies are unable to perform daily tasks properly and suffer from many harmful symptoms.
Here are different types of protein deficiencies according to Protein Deficiencies Diseases:
Protein S deficiency
Protein C deficiency
Marasmus
Kwashiorkor
Protein S and C deficiencies are not a result of malnutrition but are instead inherited disorders. (Chen, 2014) In contrast to this, marasmus and kwashiorkor are both results of extreme malnourishment and deficiencies of protein.
Protein S and C
[
]
People who are deficient in protein S and C are lacking the proteins that are present in the fluid of the blood. Protein S and C deficiencies are rare congenital disorders that cause abnormal blood clotting. (Chen, 2014) Protein C deficiencies are more common than protein S deficiencies and affect 1 out of 300 people. (Chen, 2014) Protein S deficiencies are found in every 1 out of 20,000 people – making it a much more rare deficiency. (Chen, 2014) These deficiencies make themselves present and are “characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness in the affected areas.” (Protein Deficiencies Diseases) Complications as a result of these deficiencies may occur as childhood strokes, recurring miscarriages, recurrent clots in veins, and pulmonary embolism. (Chen, 2014) It is crucial for people who suffer from these protein deficiencies to avoid activities that can cause blood clotting or seek professional help by potentially going on a blood thinner.
Marasmus
[
]
Marasmus is a devastating and common deficiency seen in young, malnourished children. Marasmus is the “most common form of acute malnutrition in nutritional emergencies” and it can often lead to fatality. (Types of Undernutrition) Young children and infants who suffer from this deficiency try to conserve energy by reducing physical activity and their bodies reduce growth. (Types of Undernutrition) Because these children are not getting the nutrients or protein that they need, their bodies’ organs will begin to limit their function, which puts the children at extreme risk.
Kwashiorkor
[
]
Malnourishment can also take on the form of extreme bloating and stomach swelling which is known as kwashiorkor. The swollen stomach is a result of fluid retention within the individual. (“Med-Health”) This form of malnourishment comes from a lack of proteins from carbohydrate sources and is more common in older children. (“Med-Health”) Clinical signs of kwashiorkor include (Types of Undernutrition):
Loss of appetite
Apathy and irritability
Changes in hair color
Dermatosis

Section 5.6 Proteins and Health
[
]
Proteins provide many health benefits to the human body, such as their participation in blood clotting, vision, making compounds, and energy. Proper blood clotting is necessary for healing injuries. The body uses proteins to make fibrin, which forms a tough clot on the injured tissue.  Then, the body replaces fibrin with the protein collagen, which results in the development of a scar and a healed wound (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016). Also, proteins are essential components in vision. The protein opsin is responsible for sending nerve impulses to the brain to start the sense of sight (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016). Furthermore, proteins are made of amino acids, which the body can use to make other compounds that are essential for normal body functions. For example, the amino acid tyrosine is used by the body to make norepinephrine and epinephrine, which are both neurotransmitters (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016). In addition, the amino acid tyrosine is also used by the body to make thyroxine, which is a hormone that participates in metabolism. Similarly, when the body does not have enough carbohydrates or fats for energy, the body breaks down proteins to release amino acids and use them for energy or to make glucose (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016).
The types and amounts of proteins consumed influences their effect on human health. There are two types of proteins, animal proteins and vegetable proteins (Yasumoto, 1993). Animal proteins are associated with a high content of saturated fat, especially red meats, and products derived from milk (Yasumoto, 1993). High intakes of saturated fats increase the risk of developing heart diseases and becoming overweight.  On the other hand, vegetable proteins are associated with a low content of saturated fat, especially nuts and legumes. Vegetable proteins help balance the lipid content in the blood and stabilize blood pressure, which as a result decreases the risk of developing heart diseases and becoming overweight (Yasumoto, 1993). Moreover, excessive intakes of proteins promote the development of osteoporosis and increases the risk of becoming overweight. Proteins and calcium are important for increasing bone density and keeping bones healthy. High intakes of proteins cause the body to excrete calcium from the body’s reserves (Symposium, 2009). When calcium levels are too low it causes bone loss, also called osteoporosis (Symposium, 2009). In addition, high intakes of proteins results in the body storing half of the excess kilocalories as body fat, which causes a gain in body tissue and increasing the risk of becoming overweight (Symposium, 2009). A low protein intake is associated with just a small increase in body tissue and no risk of becoming overweight. High proteins intakes are detrimental for people suffering from chronic kidney diseases, since excess protein cause the kidneys to overwork and as a result deteriorate the kidneys at a faster pace. Furthermore, there are some amino acids found in proteins that can have adverse effects on human health, such as homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine contribute to the development of heart diseases by increasing inflammation and the amount of oxidation in the body (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016). Also, there are some amino acids found in proteins that confer health benefits to the human body, such as arginine. Arginine helps lower the amount of homocysteine in the body and stabilize blood pressure, which as a result decreases the risks of developing heart diseases (Whitney, Rolfes, 2016).
5.6.1 Protein Insufficiency
[
]
Protein insufficiency can occur when an individual’s diet does not include enough protein or its monomer amino acids (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). A stipulation is that this is a sustained deficiency in protein rather than a one time or by-chance occurrence. Whitney and Rolfes, in 2016, stated that such an insufficiency may result in long-term degradation of one’s own body proteins to make up for the lack of amino acids. They coined this condition as “protein-energy malnutrition,” a health event that is normally accompanied by a slew of other deficiencies (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). While this condition seems harsh, its prevalence in developed nations, especially the United States, is limited due to the makeup of developed nations’ diets; many citizens of these states have high protein diets (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016).
According to Whitney and Rolfes in 2016, the recommended ratio of calcium to protein (milligrams to grams) is 20 to 1. As stated in the previous paragraph, the intake of protein is high in developed nations and this ratio is normally lower than recommended. Calcium and protein are vital to bone development, so a protein deficiency will lead to bones prone to injury and disease (Cao & Nielsen, 2010). Eventually osteoporosis can develop in the elderly or in teenagers, who have a negative caloric energy imbalance; treating patients with osteoporosis may include adding protein to their diet in order to “improve bone mineral density” (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016).
The variety of proteins incorporated into an individual’s diet may also affect weight gain or loss (Bujnowski et al., 2011). Bujnowski, in 2011, claimed that a diet insufficient in protein from vegetables and excessive in protein from animal products could result in weight gain. The opposite conditions (when the mass of vegetable protein intake exceeded the mass of animal-product protein intake) yielded the same results. Although Bujnowski’s conclusions were drawn from participants with a positive caloric balance, the weight gain was less in participants whose source of protein was mainly vegetable based than in participants whose source of protein was mainly animal-product based. Specifically, the animal-based protein eaters kcal surplus went towards more fat storage and less lean body tissue.
While Kwashiorkor is normally related to general malnutrition, protein deficiencies are a confounding cause of this disease (Kwashiorkor, n.d.). When the diet is adjusted to normal levels of carbohydrates and fats for energy levels, protein intake is necessary for rebuilding of important body structures lost due to protein-energy malnutrition.
5.6.2 Protein Excess
[
]
Protein is an abundant macronutrient which makes excessive intake a prevalent issue in many developed countries such as the United States of America, even though no Upper Limit has established due to minimal evidence (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). Excess protein is linked to heart disease because food sources that are rich in proteins from animals tend to have high levels of saturated fat. Increasing amounts of protein obtained from nuts and legumes, which are plant sources, and reducing amount of protein obtained from animal sources can decrease the risk for heart disease at the hand of protein excess. There are some studies that suggest elevated homocysteine levels as a result of high saturated fat intake, among other things, can cause an increase is risk of developing heart disease (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). Cancer is not caused by protein in itself but by foods that contain significant amounts of protein. Excessive intake of red and processed meats is linked to colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). Osteoporosis is also associated with excess protein because high protein intake causes an increase in the excretion of calcium. Increase in protein leads to increase in urinary calcium which can lead to negative calcium balance, calcium loss, and reduced bone mass (Heany & Layman, 2008). If protein intake is not proportional to calcium intake excess protein diminishes the amount of calcium in the bones. However, it is also possible that this osteoporosis may be the result of a calcium deficiency rather than an excess of protein or it may be a combination of both factors. Diets that are high in protein from animal sources are positively correlated to overweight and obesity. A study done to prove this theory found that people who ate 1,000 more calories than their recommended intake gained weight and those who consumed a high protein diet gained twice as much weight as those who consumed a low protein diet (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). Protein excess is related to the function and health of the kidneys. The products of protein metabolism are successfully excreted when fluid intake is sufficient and the kidneys are working properly. Consuming large quantities of protein requires more metabolism which causes the kidneys to work harder to excrete the end products from that metabolism (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). There is also evidence that excess amounts of protein can cause more rapid deterioration of kidneys due to hyperfiltration and an increase in glomerular pressure, although this has only been proven in situations where the kidneys are already under stress by pre-existing chronic kidney disease (Martin, Armstrong, & Rodriguez, 2005).

5.6.3 Protein Functions on Health
[
]
Proteins are made up of chains of 20 different kinds of amino acids and amino acids are divided into essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are amino acids the human body cannot synthesize on its own, and thus needs to be supplied in the diet. On the other hand, Non-essential amino acids are amino acids the human body can synthesize on its own with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen in the diet. Amino acid being the base for protein creates protein that functions as the building blocks for growth, skin, muscle, bone, cartilage and many more. Protein is needed for body development, replenishment of blood lost, replacement of dead cells, and healing of scars and wounds. Additionally, proteins in forms of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies acts to promote healthy metabolic and immune processes. Furthermore, when fat and carbohydrate levels are low in the body, protein are degraded to generate energy for the body. Excess or deficient intake of protein alters the basic compound of the body and ultimately affects health.
5.6.4 Recommendations for Protein
[
]
Protein, fat and carbohydrates are macronutrients in which the body needs large amount of, however, unlike fat and carbohydrate, the body does not store protein. As a result, protein deficiency can impair body function and protein in excess can also have effects on health. Thus, the daily recommended intake of protein for adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (Protein, 2015). The American diets usually acquire more than adequate amounts of protein and additional protein or amino acid supplements are not needed for healthy people.
5.6.5 High Protein Intake
[
]
High protein diets can skew the nutritional intake values towards a higher-than-recommended amount of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol fat. Additionally, high protein diets can lower the recommended intake of fiber. The Nutrition Committee of the Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism of the American Heart Association states, “High-protein diets are not recommended because they restrict healthful foods that provide essential nutrients and do not provide the variety of foods needed to adequately meet nutritional needs. Individuals who follow these diets are therefore at risk for compromised vitamin and mineral intake, as well as potential cardiac, renal, bone, and liver abnormalities overall” (Jeor ST, Howard BV & Prewitt TE, 2001).
High protein diets can lead to weight loss and diabetes due to a change of metabolism in which fat instead of carbohydrate are burn for fuel. Furthermore, high protein diets can also result in excess calcium excrete in urine and excessive calcium loss could result in osteoporosis (Osterweil N, 2005). Several health concerns associated with high protein diets are constipation, loss of energy, bad breath, kidney problems, difficulty concentrating, cardiovascular disease, gout, gallbladder problem, osteoporosis, diabetes, and cancer diagnoses (Physicians Committee, 2004).

Defining lipids
5.7.1 Types of Vegetarian Diets
[
]
Many people have different reasons for refraining from eating meat including religion, ethics, for the health benefits, or environmental concerns.
Health
A study done at Oregon State University found that most people who choose a vegetarian diet are seeking a healthier lifestyle.
Diets rich in plant foods have been found to "lower blood cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure levels, and lower the risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes" along with reducing the occurrences of obesity and overall cancer prevalence.
Conversely, diets involving high intakes of meat and animal products are linked to heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. Today, many animals are given antibiotics and hormones to keep them healthier and help them grow faster and larger. This is linked to increasing antibiotic resistance in humans.
Ethical Reasoning
Many vegetarians and vegans choose to abstain from animal products due to their concern about the current practices of the meat industry – the treatment, living conditions and slaughter of the animals are specifically considered cruel and unnecessary. Beyond this, many people believe that animals should simply not be used food or killed in general. In a 2006 article of
The Minnesota Daily
, Peter Singer
states that opposition to factory farming is quickly growing. Alternatives for those who disapprove of the conventional farming practices but do not want to cut animal products from their diet include selections of free-range meats and eggs and options from local, organic farms.
Ecological Impacts
Meat production is linked to excessive uses of land and water resources. For example, beef requires 100 to 300 times the amount of water as compared to vegetable crops.4 Many vegetarians argue that land used to raise livestock is wasteful and could instead be used to grow vegetable crops to directly feed and adequately nourish our current human population. Forests and woodland are most often cleared to provide land for raising cattle, accounting for up to 80 percent of deforestation and promoting land erosion.
Changing the average American diet to include mostly plant-based products, and less animal products, may reduce our use of fossil fuels and agricultural resources despite a growing population.
Religious Concerns
Many people choose a vegetarian diet based on religion. Some religions teach that our bodies are a gift from God and therefore, individuals should treat their bodies as holy and keep them healthy. Others believe that in order to reach spiritual enlightenment, they must never kill any living animal. A belief in karma, or reincarnation may also play a role in someone’s choice to be vegetarian or vegan. Different religions have their own reasoning for avoiding animal products.
• Hinduism – The Hindu god, Krishna, promoted vegetarian diets, specifically avoiding the consumption of beef, as the cow is considered sacred. In Hindu scriptures, there are many passages that recommend vegetarianism based on the idea that there is a strong link between nonviolence and spirituality.
• Jainism – Jains hold the belief that is it wrong to kill or harm any living being. Traditions respect nonviolence, non-acquision, truth, and other’s rights.
• Buddhism – The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, taught that following a vegetarian diet was a key component to becoming mindful and compassionate and relieving suffering.
• Judaism – Judaism teaches that humans are to love and protect all of creation, and forbids inflicting unnecessary pain on animals. Jewish people are expected to abide by kosher dietary laws and detailed laws which require that animals be treated humanely and never exploited.
• Seventh-Day Adventists – Promote a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet and most choose not eat meat in efforts to preserve the overall health of their mind, body, and spirit.
Economic Reasoning
Current farming practices are very expensive – raising livestock requires the use of pesticides, antibiotics, computer controlled feeding, and air circulation. Because of this, many people around the world simply cannot afford to buy and eat meat. Instead, they opt for a cheaper, plant-based, vegetarian diet to support their budget.
Most people have an idea of what it means to be a vegetarian but there is a wide array of diets that branch from vegetarianism. Because of these differences, many people disagree on what is considered a true vegetarian diet namely when it comes to semi-vegetarian diets. Vegetarian diets include: vegan, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, lacto-ovo vegetarian, and semi-vegetarian. There are also variations when it comes to religious based vegetarian diets. Recently, there have been implementations in society to cater to those with vegetarian diets such as Meatless Mondays in schools and businesses, and offering vegetarian meals in airlines and hospitals.
There are many different diets following close to what is considered a vegetarian.
A
vegan diet
doesn’t include animals, animal byproducts such as milk and honey, and products that contain items such as gelatin which is crushed animal skin and bones that is found in some processed foods (white sugar, beer, etc).
The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that veganism doesn’t include eggs or dairy products namely for ethical reasons as acquiring these products may lead to harm to the animal or premature death. Many cereals are fortified with Vitamin D as well as soymilk which vegans incorporate into their diet due to elimination of dairy products.
An
ovo-vegetarian diet
include meat or dairy products but does include other animal byproducts such as eggs. However, some ovo-groups refuse to consume fertilized eggs.
Lacto-vegetarian diet
includes dairy products but no meat or eggs.
Lacto-ovo vegetarian
includes both eggs and dairy products but no animal flesh of any kind. This diet could be at risk with consuming too much fat if full fat dairy products are used.
Raw food diets
consume plant based foods along with some raw dairy products without heating up foods which although some nutrients is lost by heat there’s a benefit in digestibility and destroys anti-nutrient factors
Some vegetarian diets are considered
semi-vegetarian
and contain animal flesh in the diet:
Pescetarian
includes eggs, dairy products, and seafood but no other meat.
Pollo-pescetarian
includes poultry into the pescetarian diet to exclude mammals from their diet.
Pollotarianism
includes no seafood but only poultry is incorporated into the diet for meat.
There are also variations when it comes to vegetarian diets namely for religious reasons such as jain-vegetarianism diets that do consume dairy products but avoid to hurt bugs by not consuming honey or eating vegetables rooted into the ground as you may cause damage to bugs.
5.7.2 Vegetarian Diet Planning
[
]
Though a vegetarian diet may seem to require different, more in depth dietary planning, the meal-planning task is the same as everyone else. The overall goal is to use a wide range of foods that provide all the necessary nutrients in the diet, while allowing for enough energy to maintain a healthy body weight. In fact, vegetarians who use milk, milk products and eggs in their diets are likely to meet nutrient recommendations as easily as nonvegetarians. Vegan vegetarians do not have these items  in their diet, so their eating patterns must make up for this by including fortified foods or supplements. MyPlate
is a helpful resource that provides tips for planning vegetarian diets, by utilizing an adaptation of the USDA food patterns. MyPlate provides a variety of options to account for all types of vegetarians and vegans, including soy milk in place of milk or items such as eggs, legumes, and soy products for protein. Though most vegetarians can obtain many of their nutrients easily through plant foods, there are areas where they are prone to lack, including iron, protein, calcium, zinc, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids.
Iron
Iron is a nutrient that can be difficult for everyone to attain. However, vegetarians and vegans may have more of a problem, as they do not have meat in their diets. There is iron in plant foods, such as dark green, leafy vegetables like spinach or legumes. Further, there is iron in whole grain breads and iron-fortified cereals. The issue with these iron sources is that they are poorly absorbed, compared to iron in meat. Fortunately, the body can actually adapt to a vegetarian diet that is low in iron by decreasing iron loss and increasing iron absorption. Further, if you consume vitamin C it will increase iron absorption.
Protein
Protein may seem to be the biggest concern with a vegetarian diet, however the protein needs are usually met. In fact, the RDA for vegetarians is the same as nonvegetarians. Specific vegetarians, such as lacto-ovo-vegetarians, can acquire the recommended amount of protein easily through animal-derived foods such as eggs. Vegetarians also receive protein from plants, but they are not digested as completely. Further, there is protein in whole grains, nuts, and seeds and some vegetarians use meat replacements. Examples of meat replacements include soy proteins that are made to look and taste like meat, poultry and seafood. These products are fortified to provide the nutrients that are found in protein from animal sources.
Calcium
Calcium is not a huge issue for vegetarians that still consume milk and milk products in their diets. However, vegans do not use milk or milk products and so are more at risk for low levels of calcium. Fortunately, there are other sources of calcium that vegans can use to make up for what they are missing. Examples of calcium rich sources include soy milk, calcium-fortified juices, figs, some legumes, some nuts, and some green vegetables. Calcium is especially important for children, so they should pay special attention to their calcium intake if they are on a vegan diet.
Zinc
Like iron and protein, meat is the richest food source for zinc. Though zinc can come from plants, it is not absorbed very well. However, vegetarian adults are not usually zinc deficient. There are plenty of foods that provide zinc in the diet, including whole grains, pinto and kidney beans, black eyed peas, and nuts. Further, zinc is found in seafood, especially oysters, if that is included in the diet.
Vitamin B12
Though the requirement for Vitamin B12 is small, it is still very important for health. A lack of vitamin B12 can result in nerve damage and health consequences such as loss of vision. Vegetarians, and especially vegans, will likely have a hard time acquiring enough vitamin B12 in their diets. There are options such as soy products and seaweeds, but some of these products present an inactive form or can lead to iodine toxicity. Thus, many vegetarians and vegans will require vitamin B12-fortified supplements or sources.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is another nutrient that can be difficult to acquire for both vegetarians and nonvegetarians. Thus, it is important to eat fortified foods and expose yourself to sunlight to make sure vitamin D is synthesized. Vegetarians and vegans in northern climates must pay special attention to their vitamin D levels, especially infants and children.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Though a vegetarian diet and a diet of someone eating meat, eggs and fish differ greatly in omega-3 fatty acids, the blood differences between the two is small. Further, vegetarians can receive omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed, walnuts, canola oil and soy.
Making the decision to become a vegetarian differs from person to person; some become vegetarians almost instantly, while others are more cautious. Being a vegetarian is as simple or as difficult as one chooses to make it. Some people find great pleasure in the creativity needed to create awesome vegetarian meals, while others are completely turned off by the amount of thought it can take to create the perfect vegetarian meal. That being said, this decision is ultimately dependent on what is best for you.

Planning anything, especially a vegetarian diet, can seem like a daunting task; however, with a proper meal plan paired with the adequate nutrition, one can create a well-planned diet that meets the guidelines to support people of all ages and stages of life. The importance is to remain cognizant of your specified nutritional needs so that you can create the perfect vegetarian diet that meets each need, as well as follows the proper health guidelines.
The word "vegetarian" often yields thoughts such as "meatless", or meals lacking fish or poultry, but despite these thoughts, vegetarian diets greatly vary in what they exclude or include. The different types of vegetarian diets include: lacto-vegetarian diets, lacto-ovo vegetarian diets, ovo-vegetarian diets, and vegan diets -which will be discussed in greater detail in the following section.
In order to sustain a healthy vegetarian diet, one must remember to incorporate a variety of different nutrient rich foods because not one single food is capable of providing the amount of nutrients that your body needs to thrive. Similar to studying for an exam, creating a vegetarian diet is all about proper planning which will ensure the diet includes everything that your body needs. These four food groups: fruits, grains, legumes, and vegetables are imperative for a healthy vegetarian diet. Fill your plate with a variety of these four things to ensure an extremely healthy and refreshing diet.
Make sure to include these major nutrients into your vegetarian diet: iron, calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. Each of the nutrients listed plays a special role in important factors such as: producing red blood cells, promoting strong bones, skin and muscle health, promoting healthy heart health, fighting anemia, and promoting a strong immune system.
5.7.3 Benefits of a Vegetarian Diet
[
]
There are many reasons for someone to adopt a plant based diet. Across the globe, vegetarianism and veganism is practiced for a variety reasons. Places like India, where Buddhism is the predominant religion, people abstain from meat for religious purposes. In coastal areas, many people adopt diets low in meat consumption because of necessity and availability of meat. Here in America, many people associate vegetarians with radical groups like PETA, but in reality, vegetarianism is practiced across the country for both the reasons mentioned above and many others. Although a sometimes controversial topic, there are many benefits to a plant based diet, both for the body's health and the health of the environment.
While some vitamins and nutrients are readily and largely available in meant, a well planned vegetarian diet can offer a variety of benefits. It’s important to monitor plant based diets and eat a wide variety of foods to insure that you are getting the appropriate nutrients. Here are a few examples of the benefits one can expect from eating a diet free from meat:
● Heart- On average, vegetarians are healthier than those who eat meat. A study published in the American Society for Nutrition found that those who were on a plant based diet had less incidence of heart disease than those on a diet that contained meat.Additionally, they found that vegetarians had lower BMI’s, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
● Eyes- Plant based diets can help reduce incidence of disease in all areas, including eyes. A 2011 study found that those who ate diets high in meat were more likely to develop cataracts than those who identified as vegan or vegetarian. Age related cataracts are a prevalent problem in aging Americans, and a change in diet may help reduce this condition.
● Skin- Some vegetarians take their diet one step further and eliminate all animal products from their diet. While some might consider this a step too far, these people reap benefits that others don’t, like having healthier skin. According to one study, people who practice veganism have lower rates of acne, which is closely related to diet (Melnik 2012). Switching to a vegan diet can help eliminate a lot of the foods (meat and dairy) that are the main drivers of acne in older teens and adults.
● Cancer- While cancer rates continue to climb, a readily available solution may be right under our noses. Studies show that eating a diet low in meat can help contribute to lower cancer rates (dos santos Silva 2002). While there are many theories as to while a plant based diet helps protect against, scientist and researchers have yet to pinpoint the exact reason that plant based diets have such preventative properties.

Defining lipids
Lipid storage
6.1 Defining lipids
[
]
As defined by Merriam-Webster - noun, concise Encyclopedia:
Any of a diverse group of organic compounds that are grouped together because they do not interact appreciably with water. One of the three large classes of substances in foods and living cells, lipids contain more than twice as much energy (calories) per unit of weight as the other two (proteins and carbohydrates). They include the fats and edible oils (e.g., butter, olive oil, corn oil), which are primarily triglycerides; phospholipids (e.g., lecithin), which are important in cell structure and metabolism; waxes of animal or plant origin; and sphingolipids, complex substances found in various tissues of the brain and nervous system. Since insolubility is the defining characteristic, cholesterol and related steroids, carotenoids (see carotene), prostaglandins, and various other compounds are also classifiable as lipids.
Lipid definition. 2013. In Merriam-Webster.com. Retrieved Jan 27, 2013, from www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lipid
Lipids are molecules comprised of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen that are typically hydrophobic (Christie, 2013). These three elements bond together to create fatty acids, which are the simplest of lipids. Sterols, phospholipids and triglycerides are also classified as lipids. Each type of lipid differs in structure. The structure of a fatty acid is a long carbon chain with a carboxyl group (COOH) on one end, while a phospholipid consists of three fatty acids and a phosphate group (PO42-) binding them together. These discrepancies in structure result in different functions for each type of lipid. These lipids not only exist within the human body, but also in plants and other animals.
Triglycerides are the most prominent lipid in nature (Whitney, 2013). They contain three fatty acid molecules that are bonded to one glycerol molecule, and are responsible for making up fat and oils (Christie, 2013). Fats can be saturated or unsaturated, the difference between the two originating in the carbon-to-carbon bonds. Saturated fats contain only single bonds between carbon atoms, while unsaturated fats contain one or more double bond. The changes in types of bonds cause differences between saturated and unsaturated fats, such as melting points and rates of oxidation.
Lipids are responsible for many functions throughout the body including the structure and function of cells. In cells, phospholipids are responsible for creating a lipid bilayer that is used as a cell membrane, which not only helps to contain the cells contents but it also helps to regulate the movement of materials into and out of the cell (Aponte-Santamaria 2012). Another major function of lipids is the production of energy. Due to the high ratio of carbon and hydrogen to oxygen, lipids can produce more than twice the energy (per gram) that a carbohydrate can produce (Whitney, 2013). When lipids are not being used they are stored in adipose, or “fat”, cells. These cells are used for insulation from fluctuating temperatures and for the protection of the body's organs. However, because these cells continue to expand and reproduce, there is almost no limit to the amount of fat that can be stored in the body. This becomes dangerous, and is the reason why lipids can be so detrimental to one's health.
The storage of fat results in weight gain, which can lead to obesity. This excess weight further increases the risk for diseases. For example, there is evidence that high body fat may contribute to the development of certain types of cancer. Another disease affected by a high level of lipids in the body is heart disease, which is the leading cause of adult death in the United States (Whitney, 2013). The higher the LDL (low–density lipoprotein) level, the higher the risk for heart disease. In order to avoid health issues such as these, it is important to maintain a level of less than 35% fat in a daily diet and to minimize intake of trans and saturated fats, as well as cholesterol.

6.1.1 Fatty acids
[
]
Saturation
Fatty Acids (FA), being one category of lipids, has even further subcategories of how they are saturated/unsaturated FA's. This stems from how all fatty acids have a chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms in their structure. These chains of carbon and hydrogen will vary in length, but saturated fatty acids (SFA) essentially have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in that chain and contain ONLY single bonds between its carbon atoms. In real life we see that these SFA are solid at room temperature (like butter) and occur a lot in animal fat, palm oil, and coconut oil. Conversely there are unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) that will have carbons with a double bond, wherever a double bond occurs is a point of unsaturation. The double bond happens because there is an absence of two hydrogens, therefore forcing the carbons in the chain to fulfill their requirement of four bonds by double bonding to the nearby carbon atom. You can visibly see that UFA's are liquid at room temperature. There are also different types of UFA's, one is mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) that lacks only two hydrogen atoms and therefore only has one double bond between carbon atoms. Typically MUFA's are found in olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil. The other type of UFA is poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) which has four or even more hydrogen atoms that forces the UFA to have two or more carbon double bonds. Typically PUFA's are found in corn oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, fish oils, and in nuts/seeds.
Fatty Acid Nomenclature
The naming of fatty acids follows a certain formatting of ∆x of which the template looks like Figure 1 (Jakubowski, 2013):
Figure 1
Monounsaturated Fatty Acid Naming
Figure 2
Monounsaturated fats follow a standard chemical naming system where number starts at the Carboxyl (COO-) terminal and proceeds to the Methyl (CH3) terminal. In this example, there is an eighteen carbon chain with one unsaturated bond at carbon number nine, in the cis formation. Therefore, its naming is, 18:1(∆9) cis-9-octadecenoic acid. (Appendix, 1976) See Figure 2.
Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Naming
Polyunsaturated fats can follow this same systematic nomenclature, or also an alternative method which is used to name our two essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
Figure 3
See Figure 3. The naming of this fatty acid could follow earlier taught principles and name this fatty acid 18:3(∆9,12,15) Alpha-linolenic acid. Or it could be named alternatively, with the Methyl group (CH3) end is named “ω” (omega) and number toward the carboxyl terminal, with the first unsaturated bond receiving the number three. This give us an omega-3 fatty acid. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are essential fatty acids. (IUPAC, 2001)

6.1.2 Triglycerides
[
]
Triglycerides are a type of fat found not only in food, but in the body as well. They can be found in all types of fats, whether they are considered healthy or not, such as saturated fats, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, and trans fats ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). Triglycerides have a number of health benefits which include providing your body with energy, they help absorb vitamins and nutrients, and they contain essential fatty acids ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d); which cannot be synthesized by the body and must be consumed via the diet. Triglycerides are also utilized by the body to build tissues, and they are carried through the blood on lipoproteins (transporters), including chylomicrons, HDL, LDL, and VLDL ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). The structure of triglycerides is formed by combining a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid tails (Khan Academy, 2014), which makes it insoluble in blood and water, hence the lipoproteins assisting in carrying them through the blood.
For as many benefits as they have, triglycerides also have their share of consequences when not consumed properly. Triglycerides should be consumed in moderation like most other foods, and when consumed in excess they can cause issues with weight and heart health ("Triglycerides: Why do they matter?" 2015). To avoid consuming too many unhealthy triglycerides, refrain from eating foods that contain trans fats such as hydrogenated oils, cokes, butterfat, and cookies, while limiting foods that contain saturated fats such as lard, cocoa butter, meat, and poultry ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). If triglyceride levels become too high in the blood, it can cause a condition known as hypertriglyceridemia. This condition may present with no onset of symptoms, and the only definitive way to know what the body's blood triglyceride levels are is to have routine blood tests ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). Another consequence of high triglyceride levels is coronary heart disease, which is a condition where blood vessels in the heart narrow due to fatty deposits and are unable to supply enough blood and oxygen ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). These fatty deposits can harden (known as plaque) and reduce elasticity of the vessels and arteries, causing high blood pressure. Large plaque deposits and tight vessels can cause chest tightness, called angina, which can lead to myocardial infarction, or a heart attack ("Triglycerides: Why do they matter?" 2015).
High levels of triglycerides in the blood can be caused by other factors besides the diet that can be uncontrollable, such as genetic predisposition, certain medical conditions, and medications ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). There are a few methods to lower triglyceride levels in the body other than avoiding certain fatty foods. It is recommended to increase physical activity and exercise to more than thirty minutes every day, eat less calories, and reduce alcohol intake. Simple ways to adjust triglyceride intake in the diet include substituting canola oil instead of butter and fish instead of red meat ("A Roadmap for managing your triglycerides and protecting your heart," n.d). Overall, triglycerides are an essential fat that we need in our diet to receive essential amino acids and be healthy, but if not consumed in moderation, can have very adverse effects on the body such as obesity, heart disease, or even arterial plaque accumulation.

6.1.3 Phospholipids and sterols
[
]
Phospholipids resemble triglycerides in many ways, but instead of having 3 chains of fatty acids like a triglyceride, phospholipids have 2 chains of fatty acids and a chain composed of a phosphate group and a compound that contains nitrogen. In Lecithin, for instance, there are two fatty acids and then a phosphate group and a choline molecule in the third spot. Choline is a molecule the body makes from the amino acid methionine, but choline can also be obtained from food sources such as milk, eggs, peanuts, soybeans, wheat germ, and liver. The phosphate group in phospholipids is hydrophilic so it can dissolve in water, and the fatty acids in phospholipids can dissolve in fat. This makes phospholipids great emulsifiers (emulsifiers can blend water and fats).
Sterols are 4-ring carbon compounds with side chains. Sterols are critical substances in the human body. Hormones that influence sex (estrogen, testosterone, etc.) and the adrenal glands (such as aldosterone), Vitamin D, cholesterol, and bile acids are all sterols. Both plant and animal foods have sterols, but plant foods do not have cholesterol. Cholesterol has a 4-ring structure typical of sterols, but has carbon side chains. It can help build the cell membrane, as most of the body's cholesterol is found there in the cell and cell membrane. Cholesterol is ideal for forming the cell membrane because of its hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, which allow the more fluid structure of the cell membrane. Additionally, cholesterol can assist in forming hormones and bile acids. The liver produces cholesterol, so not much of it needs to be consumed through the diet. Eggs, seafood, meat, and dairy foods all have cholesterol. To keep cholesterol from being absorbed in the body, plant sterols that interfere with absorption can be added to the diet. If there is an excess build-up of cholesterol, plaque can grow within the arteries, and the body can be at a threat for atherosclerosis- a disease of the arteries that can lead to strokes and heart attack, among other health concerns. The Daily Value for cholesterol is 300 mg per day, because the liver is producing roughly 800 to 1500 mg of cholesterol per day. Additional consumption of cholesterol can cause a buildup of unwanted plaque. We describe cholesterol that is consumed from our diet as exogenous, and cholesterol that is manufactured by the liver as endogenous.
While they are critically important to the human body, phospholipids and sterols constitute only a small portion of the fats in our diet- around 5%.

Lipid Functions
6.2 Lipid Storage
[
]
Summary
Lipids, which include steroids, like cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides, are either synthesized by the body or derived from the foods that one consumes in their diet. They are stored in adipocytes, which unlike other cells, have a fairly unlimited amount of storage capacity, making consuming excess fat dangerous to one’s health. Overconsumption can impair the function of these cells and other bodily processes.
Looking first at dietary lipids, or lipids that come from the foods we consume, these macronutrients begin to be digested first in the mouth. As they move throughout the digestive system, they eventually reach the small intestine where they are mixed with a secretion of bile acids and broken down into cholesterol, fatty acids, and glycerides. The cholesteryl esters and triglycerides are then prepared for transport through the body by being packed into chylomicrons along with phospholipids, cholesterol, and protein. These lipoproteins, known as chylomicrons, can then be transported through the lymph, thoracic duct, and ultimately into the bloodstream. The triglyceride portions of the chylomicrons are absorbed by different organs and tissues, such as the heart and muscle, and stored in the cells as lipid droplets.
As discussed previously, lipids can also be synthesized by your body from the remnants of other macronutrients like carbohydrates and proteins. This process occurs in the liver where either amino acids from proteins or glucose from carbohydrates can be used to form lipids. These synthesized lipids can either be stored or used in the liver, or shipped via VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) to other tissues to be stored as lipid droplets.
Lipid Digestion
Underneath the three layers, of skin (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) is adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is made up of adipocyte cells held together by collagen. There are two types of adipose tissue, white and brown. White adipose is most prevalent. Adipose tissue is in charge of collecting, storing and releasing lipids as the body sees fit. Lipids are fat-like substances that do not dissolve in water. They contain various fats, waxes, steroids, phospholipids, and triglycerides as well as others (How Are Lipids Stored in the Body) . The purpose of lipids is to produce hormones, absorb fat-soluble vitamins, provide structure to cell membranes, protect the nerves and provide the body with energy and energy storage. Lipids are the major form of energy reserve for the body.
Lipid Absorption
The body only uses the amount of nutrients and energy it needs to function, any excess after that is what is stored in the adipose tissue. Lipids are stored in the body in different forms such as, triglycerides, fat cells, cell membranes and lipoproteins. Any excess energy consumed is converted to triglycerides which together with globules make up 90% of the fat cells. These fat cells contain enough energy storage to keep the body functioning for 30 days. In the cell membranes lipids are stored as phospholipids, this is what helps give cell membranes their structure, and it also serves as a barrier. In the liver lipoproteins are made. Lipoproteins are broken down into HDL and LDL. Together they are transported in the bloodstream through other lipids and help keep cholesterol under control.
Disorders and diseases
As with all bodily processes, disorders can appear along different parts of the path and for a variety of reasons in lipid storage. For the most part however, these diseases involve either mutated enzymes that do not properly break down lipids or their bodies simply don’t produce enough of the needed enzyme to be effective. These disorders can be genetically passed down as autosomal recessive or sex-linked recessive. If the disorder is autosomal recessive, in order for the offspring to inherit the trait, both parents have to be carriers and there is still only a 25% chance they will express the disorder. If the disorder is sex-linked recessive, the offspring will have a higher chance of inheriting it if it is a male than female. As a male, if the mom is a carrier, the offspring as a male will have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
One of the most common lipid storage disorders is Gaucher disease which is caused when the body cannot produce enough of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This disorder is marked by extra fatty accumulation in the brain, liver, bone marrow, and other organs. There are three different types of it which range in symptoms and severity. Typically, the disorder can be diagnosed through biopsies, genetic testing, or looking for common symptoms which include liver enlargement, liver malfunction, swollen lymph nodes, anemia, and yellow eye spots.

How Does the Body Digest Lipids?
Before lipids can be stored in the body, they first have to be digested (“Digestion”, n.d.). The goal of digestion is to take triglycerides, which is the form that most of the fat in our diets is in, and break them apart into monoglycerides and fatty acids. (“Digestion”, n.d.). Digestion of lipids begins in the mouth, where body temperature starts to melt some hard fats (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). The enzyme lingual lipase is secreted from a gland at the base of the tongue (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). Lingual lipase helps break down milk fats, which is especially important for infants (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). Next, the fat travels down the esophagus to the stomach. Because of the hydrophobic nature of lipids, they do not dissolve well in the liquid of the stomach (“Digestion”, n.d.). However, in the stomach, the churning of the stomach breaks up the fat globules into small droplets. This is done in order to increase the surface area of the fat, making it easier for the enzymes gastric lipase to work on the droplets (“Digestion”, n.d.).  Gastric lipase hydrolyzes the droplets, but only a little of the fat. Lipid digestion occurs mostly in the small intestine (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). Once the fat leaves the stomach via the pyloric sphincter and travels to the small intestine, the hormone cholecystokinin triggers the release of bile from the gallbladder. Bile is made of bile salts and phospholipids (“Digestion”, n.d.). Bile is amphipathic, meaning that it works like a detergent to suspend the fat droplets in water and separate from each other (Joyce, 2008). This make it easier for pancreatic lipase from the pancreas can remove the fatty acids from the lipids and fully digest them. (Joyce, 2008). After the pancreatic lipase acts upon the lipids, the result is monoglycerides (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016).
How Does the Body Absorb Lipids?
The next phase after lipid digestion is absorption. Some molecules of fat, because they are small, can pass into the intestinal cells, or enterocytes, and enter the bloodstream (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). Other molecules, such as monoglycerides and long-chain fatty acids, are too large to go this route. They must mix with bile salts to form micelles (“Digestion”, n.d.). Micelles are spherical transporters that can enter the enterocytes. Micelles also contain cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins (“Digestion”, n.d.). Inside the enterocytes, the fats are reassembled into new triglycerides (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). These triglycerides and cholesterol combine with protein into transporters called chylomicrons. The chylomicrons travel through the lymph system (also known as lacteal) until they are able to enter the blood (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). As the chylomicrons travel through the body, cells remove triglycerides from the chylomicrons as they float by, making the chylomicrons smaller (Rolfes & Whitney, 2016). The liver removes whatever remaining pieces are left from the chylomicrons.
These chylomicron pieces, called chylomicron remnants, which the liver picks up can be dangerous for the body (Cooper, 1997). According to Cooper (1997, p. 2174), “the accumulation of these particles [in the liver] for prolonged periods or in high concentrations may have particularly deleterious consequences”. Chylomicron remnants are removed using apolipo- protein (apoE) and LDL receptors (Cooper, 1997). The study concludes that “delayed removal of chylomicron remnants has been documented in diabetes, renal failure, and familial combined hyperlipemia”.

Lipid Metabolism
Metabolism is a chemical process that converts food into energy to help us for everything that we do. Lipid consists of fat; speeding up metabolism helps an individual burn fat. There are three important factors that help speed up lipid metabolism: exercise, sleeping habits, and eating habits.
Decreasing sedentary actions and replacing them with physical activities helps to increase metabolism. Exercising keeps the body moving, increasing calorie loss. For adults that go to the gym frequently, any type of cardio such as swimming, aerobic exercising, or running promote calorie loss. Resistance training, lifting weights, has been recommended to speed up metabolism because bigger muscles are created. More muscle in the body equals faster metabolism. An individual doesn’t have to go to the gym to get exercise. Any physical hobby such as walking, dancing, or climbing will keep the body moving and enhance metabolism. Making small changes in your everyday life can help your metabolism as well. For example, instead of driving to the drive-thru to get food, park your car and walk inside. Walking instead of driving in your community keeps the body active; metabolism will be working at all times. Working out for at least thirty minutes, three to five times a week is efficient.
Taking too long to eat between meals hinders your metabolism. It is recommended to reduce your larger portions to smaller ones, eating up to about five to six meals a day. Eating smaller meals regulates your blood and your metabolism doesn’t have to conserve energy since it is being provided more frequently throughout the day. Ensure that every meal has a variety of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats; avoid high-saturated fat foods! Adding spices to meals will help improve metabolism as well. Staying hydrated helps the body stay active; it is recommended that an adult consume at least eight ounce, eight cups of cool water every day. Cool water is recommended because the body will spend more time trying to warm the water to your body temperature, burning more calories as a result.
Sleep is essential to not only for the mind, but for the body as well. When an individual doesn’t get enough sleep, hormones get disrupted. Ghrelin, the hormone that lets the body know that it is time to eat, rises when you don’t get enough sleep. Leptin, the hormone that lets the body know that you’re full, lowers. As a result, the body compensates by eating more than what is recommended to get energy. It is recommended for an adult to get at least seven to nine hours of sleep to maintain a healthy hormone balance.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Lipid Functions
Lipid intake
6.3 Functions: Lipids
[
]
Structuring cell membranes. The cell membrane constitutes a barrier for the cell and controls the flow of material in and out of the cell.
Energy storage. Triglycerides are an efficient form of energy storage that can be mobilized when fuel is needed.
Transmission of information in cells (signal transduction). Lipid hormones, like steroids and eicosanoids, also mediate communication between cells.
Cellular metabolism. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are required for metabolism, usually as coenzymes.
6.3.1 Essential fatty acids
[
]
Certain fats are defined as 'essential' because:
The body cannot make them;
They are required for normal cell, tissue, gland, and organ function, for health, and for life;
They must be provided from outside the body, through food or supplements;
They can come only from fats (hence fat-free diets cannot supply them);
Their absence from the diet will eventually kill;
Deficiency results in progressive deterioration, can lead to death;
Return of essential fatty acids to a deficient diet reverses the symptoms of deficiency and results in a return to health.
Omega-6 fatty acids
What are this
http://www.dietriffic.com/2012/07/12/omega-6-fatty-acids/
?
Omega 6 is a polyunsaturated fat (or PUFA) which is essential to the body, as is omega 3. Neither of these fats are produced by the body, hence the “essential” part, so you must get them via your diet.
Just to clarify, the main difference between polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat (MUFA) is in the structure.
Monounsaturated fatty acids (like olive oil) are linked by one double bond. Polyunsaturated fats are linked by multiple double bonds.
This makes polyunsaturated fats more unstable, especially during processing. In fact, even small amounts of light, moisture, air or heat may damage polyunsaturated fats.
This is one reason why it is so important to choose cooking oils carefully. Remember, “vegetable oil” does not automatically equal a healthier option.
Possibly Ineffective and Insufficient Evidence
Possibly Ineffective for:
Improving mental development or growth in infants when arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) is used in infant formula.
Insufficient Evidence for:
Increasing good cholesterol levels (HDL).
Lowering bad cholesterol levels (LDL).
Reducing the risk of heart disease.
Reducing the risk of cancer.
Omega-6 Fats
Shorter-chain:
The shorter-chain form of omega-6 is linoleic acid (LA), which is the most prevalent PUFA in the Western diet, is abundant in corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and canola oil.
Longer-chain:
The longer-chain form of omega-6 is arachidonic acid (AA), which is an important constituent of cell membranes and a material your body uses to make substances that combat infection, regulate inflammation, promote blood clotting, and allow your cells to communicate. AA is found in liver, egg yolks, animal meats and seafood.
Introduction
[
]
Omega-6 fatty acids are
cis
polyunsaturated fatty acids (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  {Please refer to
4.1 Defining Lipids
for more information regarding fatty acid structure.}  There are several omega-6 fatty acids, but the only
essential
omega-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  {Remember that an essential nutrient is one that humans cannot synthesize and must get from their diet (Jaret, 2011).}  Linoleic acid has the structural formula CH
3
(CH
2
)
3
(CH

CH=CH)

(CH

COOH (Moore, 2011).  In addition to linoleic acid, other important omega-6 fatty acids include γ-linolenic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, adrenic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).
Functions
[
]
As with other fatty acids, linoleic acid is primarily (98%) consumed as a component of triglycerides (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  Like other fatty acids, linoleic acid is a major source of energy (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005), and it helps the body absorb the fat-soluble vitamins (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  Fatty acids also play a role in cell signaling and the expression of genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).
In addition to the above functions common to all fatty acids, linoleic acid has unique functions within the body.  It is a component of membrane structural lipids and functions in specific cell signaling pathways (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  Linoleic acid is required for the synthesis of other omega-6 fatty acids, which are important for normal epithelial cell function (specifically, maintaining the epidermal water barrier) (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005). Two omega-6 fatty acids, arachidonic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, are also precursors to eicosanoids (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).
Eicosanoids are local hormones (affecting the cell that produces them and neighboring cells, but not entering the bloodstream), such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes (Moore, 2011).  There are many prostaglandins with various functions, but they all lower blood pressure, induce contractions in smooth muscles, and act as part of the inflammatory response system (Moore, 2011).  Thromboxanes are important in blood clotting (Moore, 2011).  Leukotrienes are produced by white blood cells; they are associated with allergies (Moore, 2011).
Arachidonic acid is also important in the cell membranes of the retina and brain (Duyff & Association, 2006).  It is critical for eye and brain development in infants, especially premature infants (Duyff & Association, 2006). Some infant formulas are now supplemented with arachidonic acid (in addition to linoleic acid), although the FDA has only approved these formulas for full-term infants, and the benefits of this arachidonic acid supplementation are inconclusive (Duyff & Association, 2006).
Food Sources and Dietary Recommendations
[
]
Omega-6 fatty acids are found mostly in plant-derived sources, such as nuts, seeds, and certain vegetable oils (corn oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil) (Jaret, 2011).  The main dietary form of omega-6 fatty acids is linoleic acid (Jaret, 2011).  Conjugated linoleic acid can be found in dairy and meat products from ruminants {please refer to “Conjugated Linoleic Acid” below for more information} (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  The AI for linoleic acid (based on the median intake in the United States for which there are no symptoms of deficiency in healthy persons) is 17g per day for young men and 12g per day for young women (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005). The American Heart Association recommends that omega-6 fatty acids provide at least 5% to 10% of food calories (Jaret, 2011).
Deficiency
[
]
Insufficient intake of omega-6 fatty acids causes several distinct symptoms and clinical signs: rough and scaly skin, rash, reduced growth, and an elevated ratio of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid (triene to tetraene) (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  {Please refer to
4.4.2.1 Essential fatty acid deficiency
for more information.}
Excess
[
]
No UL for omega-6 fatty acids has been set because there is not enough evidence to establish one (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  Some studies have suggested that intake of omega fatty acids is associated with decreased risk of many diseases, but the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important (specifically, that the ratio should be small) (Jaret, 2011) {see “Omega-6 to Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio” below}.  {Please refer to
4.4.1 Lipid intake: Excess
for more information.}
Omega-6 to Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio
[
]
In addition to linoleic acid, there is one other essential fatty acid: alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that is the precursor to other omega-3 fatty acids in the body (Duyff & Association, 2006).  The omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids compete within cells for the same enzyme (Δ6 and Δ5 desaturase); this enzyme’s activity is reduced by both the substrates and the products of its reaction, as well (e.g., linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid) (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  Therefore, consuming too much of either linoleic acid or alpha-linolenic acid (or other omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids) could inhibit the production of both omega-6-derived and omega-3-derived eicosanoids (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).
The typical American consumes 15 times as many omega-6 fatty acids as omega-3 fatty acids; while throughout most of human evolution, consumption of the two types of fatty acids was approximately the same (Simopoulos, 2002).  Over-consumption of omega-6 fatty acids and a very high omega-6:omega-3 ratio are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory diseases (such as asthma) and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis) (Simopoulos, 2002). {Please refer to
4.3.1.2 Omega-3 Fatty Acids
,
4.4 Lipid Intake
, and
4.4.3 Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health
for more information regarding sources of omega-3 fatty acids and their role in health.}
Conjugated Linoleic Acid
[
]
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to several different isomers of linoleic acid with adjacent double bonds (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  There is limited evidence regarding two of the isomers’ biological activity:
cis
-9,
trans
-11 (inhibits carcinogenesis and atherogenesis) and
trans
-10,
cis
-12 (reduces adipocytes’ uptake of lipids and inhibits atherogenesis) (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  CLA is present in dairy products and meat from ruminants due to a microorganism present in ruminants’ digestive tract (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).
Cis
-9,
trans
-11 CLA can be converted to vaccenic acid (in a reversible process) by mammalian cells (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).  On the other hand,
trans
-10,
cis
-12 CLA can be converted reversibly into
trans
-10 octadecenoic acid only by a microorganism since mammalian cells lack the necessary enzyme; therefore, consumption of food containing
trans
-10,
cis
-12 ClA is the only way to get this isomer (Panel on Macronutrients, 2005).

Omega-3 fatty acids
Omega-3 fatty acids are a form of polyunsaturated fat that the body derives from food. Omega-3s (and omega-6s) are known as essential fatty acids (EFAs) because they are important for good health. The body cannot make these fatty acids on its own so omega-3s must be obtained from food
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19302.htm
.
What can high-omega-3 foods do for you?
help prevent cancer cell growth
reduce the risk of becoming obese and improve the body's ability to respond to insulin by stimulating the secretion of leptin, a hormone that helps regulate food intake, body weight and metabolism, and is expressed primarily by adipocytes (fat cells)
reduce the production of messenger chemicals called cytokines, which are involved in the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis
increase the activity of another chemical derived from endothelial cells (endothelium-derived nitric oxide), which causes arteries to relax and dilate
inhibit thickening of the arteries by decreasing endothelial cells' production of a platelet-derived growth factor (the lining of the arteries is composed of endothelial cells
decrease platelet aggregation, preventing excessive blood clotting
lower the amount of lipids (fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides) circulating in the bloodstream
Maintain the fluidity of your cell membranes
Keep your blood from clotting excessively
Reduce inflammation throughout your body
There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets
http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/omega-3/
:
One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in some vegetable oils, such as soybean, rapeseed (canola), and flaxseed, and in walnuts. ALA is also found in some green vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach, and salad greens.
The other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA.
We do not know whether vegetable or fish omega-3 fatty acids are equally beneficial, although both seem to be beneficial. Unfortunately, most Americans do not get enough of either type. For good health, you should aim to get at least one rich source of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet every day. This could be through a serving of fatty fish (such as salmon), a tablespoon of canola or soybean oil in salad dressing or in cooking, or a handful of walnuts or ground flaxseed mixed into your morning oatmeal.
6.3.2 Triglycerides
[
]
Triglycerides are the most complex fat and the main type of fat in the body. They are the result of digesting the fat eaten from meals. Triglycerides are also made inside the body from sources of energy like protein and carbohydrates.
Triglycerides are found in the blood as a type of lipid and make up about 95 percent of all dietary fats. The calories that are consumed while eating are in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The other calories that are not needed for immediate use are converted into this type of lipid and are stored in the body’s fat cells (Hal Bender, 2001, 2003). This leads to the point that the main function of triglycerides is to store energy for later use. The fat cells that hold the triglycerides holds these molecules until the body indicates that it is in need of energy, such as in between meals (Mayo Clinic, 1998–2015). With the help of hormones, these stored triglycerides are released in order to provide this energy between meals. However, if more calories are consumed than burned by the body, the body’s triglyceride level will increase, and this may lead to negative effects. Without triglycerides the body would run out of energy, unless calories are being constantly consumed.
Triglycerides include saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats. Saturated fats have single bonds and have the maximum number of hydrogen bonds. They should be avoided, as they are the main cause of high LDL levels. Unsaturated fats lack hydrogen bonds and have at least one double bond that is considered the “point of unsaturation.” Monounsaturated fats lack two hydrogen atoms and have one double bond, while polyunsaturated fats lack at least four hydrogen atoms with two or more double bonds. Polyunsaturated fats are essential and are obtained through diet. Two common forms of polyunsaturated fats are linoleic acid (omega-6) and linolenic acid (omega-3). Trans fat are similar to saturated fats in the way they act. They are linked to heart disease and trans fats were originally created to to increase the shelf life of products protecting against oxidation, a process known as hydrogenation. Not all trans fat is bad, for example conjugated linoleic acid, which is natural and can be beneficial.
Triglyceride (triacylglycerol, TAG or triacylglyceride):
Is an ester composed of a glycerol bound to three fatty acids. It is the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats.
Most of the fats digested by humans are triglycerides. Triglycerides are formed from a single molecule of glycerol, combined with three molecules of fatty acid. The glycerol molecule has three hydroxyl (OH-) groups. Each fatty acid has a carboxyl group (COOH-). In triglycerides, the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol join the carboxyl groups of the fatty acid to form ester bonds.
Triglycerides in normal amounts are important to good health, but high amounts of triglycerides increase the risk for heart disease and stroke. High triglycerides is also one of the components of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of health problems that occur together.Your triglyceride level is measured by a blood test called a lipid profile. A lipid profile shows your triglyceride level, total cholesterol level, HDL (good) cholesterol level, and LDL (bad) cholesterol level.
A blood test can be taken in order to determine whether or not a person’s triglyceride level falls within the acceptable range. Triglycerides have an important function when it comes to determining someone’s heart health. High levels of this fat can have a negative effect by increasing the risk of heart disease.
Levels of Triglycerides Important for Health
There are several ranges of triglycerides to take note of when determining if someone is at an adequate level for their health (2015).
•	Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or less than 1.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) indicate a normal level of triglycerides.
•	150 to 199 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.2 mmol/L) is not a significantly high level, but does indicate a borderline high range of triglycerides.
•	200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3 to 5.6 mmol/L) indicates a high level of triglycerides.
•	500 mg/dL or above (5.7 mmol/L or above) indicates a very high level of triglycerides.
If the triglyceride level exceeds the acceptable normal range, the high level of this fat may harden the arteries or thicken the artery walls, also known as atherosclerosis. Extremely high levels of triglycerides, 1000 mg/dL (11.29 mmol/L) may contribute to acute pancreatitis (1998–2015). High levels of triglycerides can be signs of many health defects and problems. For example, high levels may indicate hypothyroidism, liver disease, kidney disease, a sign of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, or even indicate that there may be a genetic condition that affects how the body is able to turn stored fat into useable energy (1998–2015).
Energy
They have a very important function, in that most cells in the body use triglycerides for energy. (One notable exception is the brain cells, which do not use them for energy.) They are the most concentrated form of energy found within the body, producing more than twice the amount of energy per gram than other forms of energy, protein and carbohydrates. This is why the body can store large amounts of triglycerides.
Triglycerides’ main function is storing the energy in fat for the body to use later on. When the body consumes more calories than needed, it will store the excess calories as triglycerides. They are held by fat cells that will release the triglycerides once they receive hormonal signals that indicate the body is ready to use this energy. Without triglycerides, one would have to be constantly eating in order to avoid running out of energy.
Insulation
Triglycerides in your adipose tissues protect your body from changes in temperature
http://www.livestrong.com/article/245739-what-are-the-benefits-of-triglycerides/#ixzz2Oa2PXJzR
. The tissues form insulation around your body and cushion the internal organs to protect them against shock or blunt trauma. Glands in the skin and mucous membranes contain triglycerides that lubricate tissues to prevent dryness and irritation.
Protection of organs
Triglycerides protect organs such as the heart and kidneys from damage and heat loss.
The major storage site of triglycerides is adipose tissue, white adipose and brown adipose. Adipose tissue also insulates the body to maintain an optimal temperature and cushion the internal organs.
Protecting your heart
:
Some of the immunosuppressive medications you are taking may increase your cholesterol levels and/or your blood pressure. If cholesterol levels get too high, blood vessels may become partially clogged, slowing or blocking the flow of blood. This increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Eating foods that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your blood cholesterol to unhealthy levels. There are three main types of blood cholesterol or blood lipids: low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.
Effective ways of reducing triglyceride levels and reducing the body’s chances of developing heart disease include cutting calories if you are overweight, reducing saturated fat and trans fat intake, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, drinking alcohol in moderation as it can affect the blood triglyceride levels, and completing 30 minutes of exercise 5 days a week. The FDA recommends 10% of calorie intake to be from saturated fats and a total fat caloric intake of no more than 30%. Accumulation of triglycerides themselves may not be enough to increase the risk of heart disease unless HDL levels decrease and LDL levels increase.
kidney:
People with high blood levels of triglycerides may suffer from reduced kidney function, which can lead to kidney disease. Doctors may recommend treatments to lower triglycerides and help patients manage their kidney disease.
High cholesterol is a linked abnormality of kidney failure. People with kidney failure usually have triglyceride levels, exceeding over 200 mg because they are not broken down by the kidney, but by the enzymes in the liver. Unknown causes have made the enzymes less active during kidney failure, which causes triglycerides to accumulate.
6.3.3 Phospholipids
[
]
Phospholipids are a class of lipids that consist of two fatty acyl molecules esterified at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerol, and contain a head group linked by a phosphate residue at the sn-3 position.
. Phospholipids are arranged in a bilayer form and make up the plasma membrane. They are perfect for this role due to their amphipathic nature or ability to have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The hydrophobic or “water fearing” region consists of long nonpolar fatty acid tails. The tails easily interact with nonpolar molecules, but cannot interact with water. The hydrophilic or “water loving” region consists of a head that contains a negatively charged phosphate group. Since the head is polar and charged, it can interact with water.
In a bilayer, the hydrophilic heads face outwards to interact with fluids and the hydrophobic tails are tucked in the interior, shielded from surrounding water. If the phospholipids have small tails, they can form a single-layered sphere (a micelle) and if they have bulky tails, they can from a hollow bilayer membrane (a liposome).
Cell membranes
All living cells and many organelles internal to cells are bounded by thin membranes. These membranes are typically described as phospholipid bilayers and are composed primarily of phospholipids and proteins.
Cell Membrane Lipids
1.	Glycolipids are located on cell membrane surfaces and have a carbohydrate sugar chain attached to them. They help the cell to recognize other cells of the body.
2.	Cholesterol is another lipid component of cell membranes. It helps to stiffen cell membranes and is only found in animal cells.
3.	Phospholipids are a major component of cell membranes. They form a lipid bilayer, in which their hydrophilic (attracted to water) head areas spontaneously arrange to face the aqueous cytosol and the extracellular fluid, while their hydrophobic (repelled by water) tail areas face away from the cytosol and extracellular fluid. The lipid bilayer is semi-permeable, allowing only certain molecules to diffuse across the membrane.
Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions vital to the survival of organisms:
1.	Cell adhesion molecules allow cells to identify each other and interact. For example, proteins involved in immune response.
2.	Membrane enzymes, such as Oxidoreductases, Transferases and Hydrolases.
3.	Transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane. They can be categorized according to the Transporter Classification database.
4.	Membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the cell's internal and external environments.

6.3.4 Sterols
[
]
Sterols, also known as steroid alcohols, are a subgroup of the steroids and an important class of organic molecules. They occur naturally in plants, animals, and fungi, with the most familiar type of animal sterol being cholesterol. Cholesterol is vital to cellular function, and a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones.
Cell structure
Bile
Bile formation occurs by secretion of bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and inorganic anions, and many transport systems for these substances have been identified in both the sinusoidal plasma membrane and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes
Bile acids (bile salts) are polar derivatives of cholesterol. They are formed in the liver from cholesterol, and drained into the hepatic duct. From there, they can enter the small intestine via the common bile duct or the gallbladder via the cystic duct. Bile is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. As bile flows through the ducts, its consistency is modified by the addition of a bicarbonate-rich liquid. Once bile acids enter the small intestine, they aid digestion of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. The bile acids are amphipathic, with detergent properties. They emulsify fat globules into smaller micelles, increasing the surface area accessible to lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes. The bile acids also help to solubilize lipid breakdown products. Secretion of bile salts and cholesterol into the bile by the liver is the only mechanism by which cholesterol is excreted. Bonded to lipids, bile acids form micelles, which enter the blood stream. The cholesterol and bile acids of micelles are reabsorbed in the small intestine, returned to the liver via the portal vein, and may be re-secreted. This is the enterohepatic cycle.
Bile
is a bitter-tasting, dark green to yellowish brown digestive fluid.  In most vertebrates, bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in digestion and absorption of lipids (fats) in the small intestine.  Adult humans produce 400 to 800 ml of bile each day and store concentrated bile in the gallbladder (Fox, 2011).  Typical mammalian bile is made up of water (82%), bile acids (12%), phospholipids (4%), cholesterol (1%) and assorted solutes (1%) (Agellon, 2002).
Bile is part of the biliary system, which helps in digestion of food, specifically emulsification of fat, and helps to excrete waste products from the liver into the duodenum and eventually exit the body through the large intestine (colon).  The biliary system is made up of the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder and other associated structures that are involved in the production and transportation of bile.  Important components of bile composition include cholesterol, bile salts (also called bile acids), bilirubin (a breakdown product of red blood cells), water, body salts (like potassium and sodium), and small amounts of copper and other metals (Bowen, 2011).  Other substances include fatty acids, lecithin, calcium, chlorine, and bicarbonate ions.
Bile Pathways
The liver is the largest internal and most metabolically active organ in the human body. It is responsible for producing bile for food digestion. Bile in the liver has high concentrations of water, sodium, chlorine, and bicarbonate.  Bile is found throughout the biliary system and is present during digestion, especially after a high fat intake.
Bile is continually made and secreted by the liver into the bile ducts for storage in the gallbladder or for fat digestion in the small intestine.  Bile is created in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) from cholesterol.  Once food is consumed, the partially digested food, known as chyme, enters the duodenum from the stomach. Subsequently, the acid and chyme stimulate the secretion of cholecystokinin and secretin.  When bile is in the gallbladder, an enzyme called cholecystokinin (CCK) senses the presence of fat in the duodenum. It then stimulates the gallbladder to contract, causing bile secretion into the duodenum through the common bile duct (Graefer, 2012).  As cholecystokinin signals the release of bile, it also causes the release of digestive enzymes into the duodenum from the stomach. As a result, secretin is released and signals the pancreas and bile ducts to release bicarbonate, in an effort to neutralize the stomach acid. Once digestion is fully complete, bile acids and other enzymes return to the liver through the hepatic portal vein or move into the colon for excretion.  Approximately 95% of the bile acids released into the duodenum are reabsorbed in the liver and are re-circulated 6-10 times per day (Fox, 2011). These bile acids are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum. This blood subsequently is directed to the portal vein and the sinusoids of the liver. Hepatocytes are available to separate the bile acids from the sinusoidal blood and trap them so that little escapes the liver. The bile acids are then transported from the hepatocytes to be secreted into canaliculi. This enterohepatic re-circulation process continues until the bile salts have been used efficiently.
Function
Bile acts as a surfactant to help emulsify fats in food.  In most vertebrates, bile acids are amphipathic molecules in which they have both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic component.  In the presence of fats in the small intestine, the hydrophobic side will migrate and attach to lipids, and the hydrophilic tail will face the outside, thus forming a micelle.  These micelles allow triglycerides and phospholipids to be absorbed by the small intestine through a structure called villi and later absorbed by the lymphatic system through lacteals. In this way, bile creates an aqueous environment to ease the solubility and transport of liquids. Additionally, bile is important in the transport and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
Here are some basic functions of bile:
Neutralizing and precipitating acid peptones
Bile is alkaline and helps neutralize any excess stomach acid before it enters the duodenum
Stimulant for organs
Moistening and lubrication
Aids in absorption
As Excrement
Emulsification of fats
Bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholic and cholic acid, modify lipids to create a less hydrophobic molecule, enabling it to interact in an aqueous environment more efficiently (Agellon, 2002)
Emulsifiers are very important aids in metabolizing lipids (fats) as well as aiding in digestion of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K)
As an antiseptic
Bile acts as a bactericide, killing many harmful microbes that may be present in food
Antioxidant
Bile helps to expel toxins from the liver when bacteria, viruses, and toxins are present
Increases absorption of fats; integral part of the absorption of fat soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K)
Carries excess cholesterol out of the body by dumping it into the gastrointestinal tract where it is excreted as part of fecal matter
Bile Deficiencies and Complications
In the absence of bile, the body can’t metabolize fats, which results in deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as utilization of calcium (Graefer, 2012).  This will lead to dry skin, excessive burping after eating a meal high in fat, nausea, gas, and bloating.
If bile is created in access it can be cytotoxic to the body.  This can occur due to an acquired defect or physical obstruction in the body, which causes bile acid to accumulate.  Common bile duct stones, narrowing of the bile duct due to inflammation, and cancer are all causes for bile accumulation (Fang, 2012).  Common symptoms are jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and necrosis (damage to the mitochondria) when breakdown products of red blood cells accumulate (McEvoy, 2011).
Cirrhosis – chronic liver disease where healthy liver tissue is replaced with fibrosis, scar tissues and regenerative nodules, which leads to loss of liver function.  Commonly caused by hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholism and fatty liver disease.
Insufficient amount of bile salts – causes heartburn or chest pain, back up of toxicity, and poor hormone synthesis. Alkaline bile salts neutralize foods and emulsify fats that allow for smooth digestion.  Also abdominal tightness, bloating and difficulty digesting fats occur (McEvoy, 2011).
Gallstones (also referred to as cholelithiasis) – salts and cholesterol become out of balance and a build up of toxins occurs in the liver creating stones.  These stones can develop from build up of cholesterol, bilirubin, calcium salts, or a mix of these.
Uses of Bile:
Bile Soap
- Bile from slaughtered animals can be mixed with soap.  It is found to remove tough stains from textiles if applied a few hours before washing.
Bear Bile
- Ursodeosycholic acid, which is found in bear bile, has been used in China for hundreds of years for medicinal purposes.  It is found to be therapeutically useful for treating primary biliary cirrhosis and dissolving gallstones (Agellon, 2002).  This process of milking bears for their bile is legal in China, but with recent decreases in the bear population more individuals are speaking out against caging bears and harvesting bear bile (Bristow, 2012).

4.3.4.3 Hormones
[
]
Hormones are chemical signaling molecules produced by endocrine glands and secreted directly into the bloodstream. They travel through the bloodstream to certain organs and tissues, where they bind to cell sites (receptors). When bound to receptors, hormones can trigger different responses. They allow for the communication of information throughout the body.
Example of hormones:
Cortisol:
Cortisol is a sterol hormone produced in the adrenal glands. It is released in response to stress, fasting, food, exercising and psychosocial stressors. Cortisol helps to regulate energy to meet demands placed on the body.  Cortisol raises the level of glucose in the blood and helps the brain use glucose. It decreases functions that are not as important during the fight or flight response. For instance, it suppresses the digestive and reproductive systems and alters the immune system response. Cortisol also affects mood, motivation and fear.
Vitamin D:
Vitamin D is technically a hormone rather than a vitamin. It is essential for normal growth and development. It helps maintain bones and teeth and influences the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. With the help of sunlight, the body can synthesize vitamin D from cholesterol in the skin. Vitamin D qualifies as a hormone because it is manufactured in the body, travels to parts of the body and can trigger a response.
The primary target sites for vitamin D are the intestines, kidneys and bones. These components respond to the influence of vitamin D by making calcium available for bone growth. Vitamin D is needed to make the protein that binds calcium in the intestinal cells. A deficiency of vitamin D creates a calcium deficiency too since calcium absorption is hindered without vitamin D.

Lipid Functions
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Lipid intake
Lipids and Health
6.4 Lipid Intake
[
]
Total fat intake for
Children 2-3 years: 30-35% of calories for date
Children 4-18 years: 25-35% of calories for date
Adults: 25-30% of calories for date
Less than 10% of daily calories should be from saturated fatty acids
Maximize the amount of poly - monounsaturated fats compared to other sources of fat.
Minimize the amount of saturated fat intake.
Minimize trans fat as much as possible
Fat intake greater than 35% of calories and increased intake of saturated fat are both associated with height risk of heart disease
Omega-3 Intake: Cardiac societies recommend the intake of 1 g/day of the two omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for cardiovascular disease prevention, treatment after a myocardial infarction, prevention of sudden death, and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Review Cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 fatty acids Clemens von Schacky, William S. Harri, Cardiovascular Research 73 (2007) 310–315.
In the body, lipids provide energy, insulate against extreme temperatures, protect against shock, and maintain cell membranes however our lipid intake needs to be monitored (Whitney, E., 2007). To monitor our lipid intake one will have to monitor the amount of fats consumed.  The amount of fats consumed should be no more than 20-35% of daily calories. There are several different fats like saturated, unsaturated and Trans fats. Saturated fats compared to unsaturated fats should be consumed in the least amount of quantity.  Saturated fats are typically found in animal products so food sources like beef, chicken and etc. contain saturated fats. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans less than 10% of fat consumed should be saturated. There should be a greater concentration of mono- and polyunsaturated fats in the fat intake. A higher consumption of polyunsaturated can be obtained through food sources like fish, nuts and legumes. It is also important to maintain the recommendation for omega 6 and omega 3 which is 5-10% and 0.6-1.2% respectively.  The amount of Trans fat consumed should be very minimal or none existent at all (DGA 2010).   The body does use some of saturated fats for metabolic and structural functions but it is not necessary to use saturated fats because these functions can be accomplished by other sources to meet most needs.  There has been evidence that indicated that higher intake dietary saturated fats are associated with higher levels of blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (DGA 2010). These higher levels in the blood total can increase the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Therefore it is very important to monitor the fat intake because of the possible health effects.
SanGiovanni conducted a study on elderly participants ranging from 60–80 years old to determine the correlation between lipid intake and severity of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  SanGiovanni noticed that higher intake of polyunsaturated fats and fish was associated with a decrease likelihood of having age-related macular degeneration (SanGiovanni 2007). There are more findings that continue to confirm the better effect of polyunsaturated on in health.  Oh observed 787441 women in 1980 who were free of cardiovascular disease and a follow up 20 years later noticed women with increase polyunsaturated fats in their diets compared to saturated fats had a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and Trans fat intake was associated with higher risk for cardiovascular (Oh 2005).  Therefore avoiding food sources with partially hydrogenated oils and solid fats will help minimize the amount of Trans and saturated fats in the diet and lower health risks.
6.4.1 Excess
[
]
Cardiovascular Health:
Excessive fat intake is most detrimental to cardiovascular health. Saturated fat is the leading cause of high cholesterol levels in most adults. It is found in a wide variety of foods, many of which are often promoted as healthy, such as milk, cheese and other dairy products. For optimal heart health, limit your intake of saturated fat to less than 10 percent of your overall calorie intake.
Besides the cholesterol implications due to high fat intake, obesity is a factor in the causation of disease. Being overweight or obese is highly associated with increasing the risk of type II diabetes, gallbladder disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension , and osteoarthritis.
Cancer:
An excess of fat and a shortage fiber in your diet can cause cancerous cellular growth, which can spread too many organs. The Office of the Surgeon General reports that overweight conditions resulting from too much fat consumption also increase your risk for developing cancer of the colon, gallbladder, kidney and reproductive organs.
Sadly, obesity is a growing disease in modern American society. Throughout the century, more families across the country take less time to cook at home, and spend more time eating at restaurants where food is more convenient (fast and cheap), but high fat content. Most of the foods served in fast food industry have been fried in oil, which makes its lipid content extremely high. Lack of education about these foods and how harmful too much lipid intake is for your body leads Americans to be the most obese country on the planet. Lack of balance of the macronutrients in the typical American diet leads to the disease we call obesity.
Recent studies show that the balance of lipid intake with other macronutrients can contribute to a healthier body and a way to avoid obesity. One particular study published by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, showed that there was a significant amount of evidence that lipid intake plays a direct role in the development and treatment of obesity. Based on 28 trials on both animal and human subjects, Bray (1998) concluded that the lipid intake has an effect on obesity.
Obesity is characterized by the accumulation of excess body fat (Bray, 1998). Based on the data obtained from the clinical trials, the it was determined that the slow but constant intake of too much dietary fat (lipids) would lead to an increase in obesity. Fat and carbohydrates are were found to make you equally feeling satiated 15 min after consumption, but 3.5 hours later, fat would still giving you the feeling of satiety, where carbohydrates does not. (Shide, 1995).
In addition, high fat diets causing obesity can be difficult to reverse. In a study done by Faust et al (1978), showed that rats on a high fat diet had a large increase in adipocytes, regardless if the mice were fed saturated or unsaturated fats. Researchers wanted to see if a change in diet would allow the rats to go back to their normal weight, or below their weight if they were put on a low fat diet. Rolls et al (1980), determined that even if rats ate a high fat diet, they did not return to their original weight, even when fed a low-fat diet. The extra adipose cells still remained in the body, collecting any fat in the rats diet and storing it immediately. That is why obesity in the human population is so hard to reverse because when you are obese you have extra fat cells that store any fat you consume. It takes a long sustained diet of healthy, moderate fat intake to return to a normal level.
A high cholesterol level is detrimental to health and leads to a condition known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the build-up of cholesterol on the walls of arteries, which may eventually result in the blocking of blood flow. When this occurs in the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery disease.

Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency
[
]
Clinical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency include a dry scaly rash, decreased growth in infants and children, increased susceptibility to infection, and poor wound healing. Omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids compete for the same desaturase enzymes. The desaturase enzymes show preference for the different series of fatty acids in the following order: omega-3 > omega-6 > omega-9. Consequently, synthesis of the omega-9 fatty acid eicosatrienoic acid increases only when dietary intakes of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are very low; therefore, mead acid is one marker of essential fatty acid deficiency. A plasma eicosatrienoic acid:arachidonic acid ratio greater than 0.2 is generally considered indicative of essential fatty acid deficiency . In patients who were given total parenteral nutrition containing fat-free glucose-amino acid mixtures, biochemical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency developed in as little as 7–10 days. In these cases, the continuous glucose infusion resulted in high circulating insulin levels, which inhibited the release of essential fatty acids stored in adipose tissue. When glucose-free amino acid solutions were used, parenteral nutrition up to 14 days did not result in biochemical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency. Essential fatty acid deficiency has also been found to occur in patients with chronic fat malabsorption and in patients with cystic fibrosis. Recently, it has been proposed that essential fatty acid deficiency may play a role in the pathology of protein-energy malnutrition

6.4.2 Excess
[
]
Not all fats are harmful to a person’s overall health! Humans need fat to survive. As a result, when we do not eat enough fat the body is more susceptible to deficiencies of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S. (2016). Understanding nutrition (14th ed.). Australia: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.). Since these vitamins are fat soluble your body needs fat to put them to use. Diets too low in fat can deprive someone of energy, vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. Deficiencies of the fat soluble vitamins will lead to chronic health consequences that may ultimately become fatal.
The human body is incapable of making only two fatty acids; linoleic acid and linolenic acid. These essential fatty acids need to be obtained from dietary fat intake (Alpha-linolenic acid. (n.d.).). Some foods that provide an abundance of linoleic acid and linolenic acid include fish, nuts, vegetable oils, and seeds (Search Results. (n.d.). Retrieved November 27, 2015). These essential fatty acids can also be obtained in lesser value in solid fatty foods such as pizza, bacon, cheeseburgers, hot dogs, sausages, ribs, and steaks.
Unfortunately, in America much of the essential fatty acids are obtained from solid fats that offer small amounts of the essential fatty acids and abundant saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. Health issues arise when intake of solid fats become excessive. They contribute to chronic heart disease, unhealthy weight gain, and obesity (6 Risks of Eating a Low-Fat Diet. (n.d.).). Unlike protein and carbohydrates that contribute 4 kcalories per gram of energy, fat provides 9 kcalories per gram of energy (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S. (2016). Understanding nutrition (14th ed.). Australia: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.).
Because fat provides so much energy it can easily tip person’s energy balance in the positive direction; which is where a person consumes more energy than they expel through physical activity, thermic effect of food, and basal metabolic rate. Moderation and variety of intake of solid fats are key to maintaining enough of essential linoleic acid and linolenic acid.
The dietary reference intakes (DRI) and Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that a 2,000 kcalorie per day diet should include 400 to 700 kcalories from fat; that is about 20 to 35 percent of total kcalories. These recommendations assume that diets with up to 35 percent kcalories from fat can be deemed healthy if intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol is low.
If saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol are the bad fats, what are the good fats? Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are the healthiest fats! Healthy fat consumption is defined by the consumption of unsaturated fats. These foods provide the most linoleic acids and linolenic acids. More unsaturated food items include olives, mayonnaise, avocados, salad dressing, and peanut butter (Foods High in Linoleic Acid. (n.d.).).
As you can see, it is not as easy to consume 400 to 700 kcalories of nuts, fish, and peanut butter as it is to consume meats, chocolate, and eggs on a daily basis. Saturated fats taste better and are more fulfilling, but hurt your overall health in the long run.

There are two types of fats in our diet that are either good or bad. For instance, Saturated and trans fat can be harmful because it increases the risk of heart diseases. Tropical oils, high fat dairy foods, and fried foods are examples of both saturated and trans fat. The good fats are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats because they can actually decrease the risk of coronary heart diseases and lower blood pressure levels. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 states that people should “consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids by replacing them with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids” (DGFA, 2010, p. X). Vegetable oil, fish, nuts, and lean meats are some examples of what one should consume to obtain a healthy diet.
Obesity is one of the biggest leading factors in the United States. Over consumption of calories due to high fat intakes can cause someone to become overweight. They can also develop cardiovascular diseases due to their increase in blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, diabetes, and lack of physical activity.  One type of cardiovascular disease is Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis will form a plaque inside the blood vessels and accumulate platelets, which can then lead to a coronary heart disease. Some ways to decrease the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease is by reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and increasing HDL cholesterol instead. It is important to limit oneself in their intake of saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, and foods high in cholesterol. Not only is improving diet a good option, but also adding some exercise on a daily basis. Exercising will help strengthen the heart and cardiovascular system. It will improve circulation, lower blood pressure, improve sleep, and reduce stress.
Any type of exercise can help decrease blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol instead. In a study by Jens Bangsbo et al, it was found that “total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are lower after a period of recreational football training” (Bangsbo et al., 2015, p. 4). This is just an example of how exercising can be very beneficial in a style of living. It will not only give you energy, but it will also improve the body’s overall health. In this study, “ young and middle-aged men, training for 12 weeks led to a significant 15 % decrease in LDL cholesterol and a non-significant 8% increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels” (Bangsbo et al., 2015, p. 4). Exercising is critical and can be a way to offset fat in the human body.
6.5.1 Cardiovascular Disease
[
]
Lipids are fats that play a major role in numerous functions of the body. They are necessary for supplying energy to the body and maintaining cell membranes, however, if consumed in excess, they can make an individual more susceptible to obesity and cardiovascular diseases (3). In order to ensure one is not taking in too much fat, one must look at the concentrations of each lipid in their blood, also known as their blood lipid profile (3). The following is the recommended blood lipid profile (3):
Total cholesterol	<200 mg/dL
LDL cholesterol	<100 mg/dL
HDL cholesterol	>60 mg/dL
Triglycerides 		<100 mg/dL
Heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States (3). It is caused by a number of things, but lipids play a major role in increasing that risk. Although a certain amount of lipids is necessary, if an individual does not consume the recommended daily intakes, they are only hurting themselves.
Cholesterol and triglycerides are two lipids that are essential to the body. Cholesterol helps construct cells and produce hormones, and is transported through our bloodstream by lipoproteins (2). The amount of cholesterol is then computed from triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (2). An excess amount of LDL, or what is also known as the “bad cholesterol,” is a main contributor in the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (2). A plethora of LDL is susceptible to oxidation which provokes inflammation and build up in the walls of the blood vessels and arteries, leading to blockage, heightened blood pressure and atherosclerosis, a form of heart disease (1,2). The  higher the LDL, the higher the risk and likelihood of heart disease. While LDL has been found to drastically increase your risk for heart disease, HDL has been found to do the opposite. In fact,
the higher the HDL, the lower the chance of CVD, because it directs the cholesterol to the opposite direction of the bloodstream (1).
Saturated and trans fats are common causes of an increased LDL. However, some saturated fats raise blood cholesterol levels more than others. Lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids raise the levels, but stearic acid appears to slightly or not at all effect them (3). Due to the two types of fats being found in similar food items, nutritionists will recommend one to consume foods with little to no saturated fats in order to reduce the risk altogether. Saturated fats have also been found to promote blood clotting, which has been found to advance CVD (3). High amounts of trans fat in the diet lead to a higher LDL and a lower HDL, another reason its highly recommended to limit the amount of the two of them in the diet (3).
Triglyceride, another fat, levels vary on the person, but if found to have elevated levels in the body, it can contribute to CVD (1). Dietary cholesterol has been found to only slightly or not at all raise blood cholesterol levels, however, it is still recommended to reduce it in your diet to lower the risk of heart disease (3).
You can lower your risk for heart disease by reducing the amount of saturated and trans fats in meals, and avoiding foods with added sugar (2). Adding fiber, losing weight, and regularly participating in aerobic exercise will also contribute to lowering your risk by increasing HDL (2). One should strive to keep their blood lipid profile within the recommended concentrations in order to limit the chances of cardiovascular disease (3).

6.5.3 Body Cholesterol and Triglycerides
[

While some fats in the body are essential for good health, others may be harmful. Two types of fats that can be beneficial for health are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. It is suggested that these fats can lower bad LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol, which therefore improves overall blood cholesterol levels (American Heart Association, 2015). On the other hand, saturated and trans fats can negatively impact ones health. In this case, it is recommended that a person eats more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats for good health altogether.
Some sources of monounsaturated fats include oils such as olive, peanut, and canola oil. In addition, avocados, peanut butter, nuts and seeds all contain monounsaturated fats as well (Zeratsky, 2015). As for polyunsaturated fats, the best food source for omega-3 fatty acid is fish. Seafood is very rich in these good fats, and the best choices include salmon, tuna, and oysters (Harvard Health). Other omega-3 fatty acid food examples are flax seeds and walnuts.
There are some major benefits to eating monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. One example of a benefit is reduced risk of heart disease and stroke by reducing blood pressure (Harvard Health Publications, 2015). In addition, such fats can help build cell membranes and the covering of nerves, which is needed for blood clotting, muscle movement, and inflammation (Harvard Health Publications, 2015). Furthermore, it is essential to eat these types of fats because they provide the body with energy and help absorb vitamins and minerals.
In this case, the consumption of bad dietary fats like saturated and trans fat will ultimately lead to health consequences. For example, saturated and trans fat will increase the risk of heart disease by increasing the bad cholesterol. This in turn, leads to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which could potentially result in a heart attack or even death (Zeratsky, 2015). Furthermore, other negative health effects of these bad dietary fats include risk of developing type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer (Zeratsky, 2015). For these reasons, people should begin to replace unsaturated and trans fats in their diet with the more healthy kinds to prevent these diseases. Some easy changes to the diet could be avoiding fried or packaged foods, and substituting unhealthy, hydrogenated oils with olive oil instead.
However, it is important to note that while these good fats are essential to ones health, it is wise to consume these in limited quantities and not go overboard. All fats are high in calories and too much of them can still wreak havoc on a person’s health. Therefore, it is crucial that people eat the good fats in moderation.
6.5.3 Body Cholesterol and Triglycerides
When you think of fats, most people think of something negative in terms of health. However, many people may not know that there are some fats that are essential for health. Actually, some fats can improve your overall health and are needed in the diet. These fats include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats which include omega-3 fatty acids. These types of fats have shown to have health benefits such as lowering blood cholesterol levels and lowering the risk for heart disease. These types of fat are essential fatty acids that need to be obtained through diet. One important function of these fats is for the fat soluble vitamins: A, E, D, and K to get into and around the body (Robinson, 2015).  Each of these fats contributes to a higher level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol which can help clean out some of the bad cholesterol in the blood, and lower the risk for cardiovascular disease (Vann, 2010).
Sources for monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats:
•	Avocados
•	Olives
•	Nuts
•	Natural nut butters
•	Sunflower, Sesame, Pumpkin Seeds
•	Flax Seeds
•	Fish Oils (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines)
So how do you know when a fat is a bad fat or a good fat? Since fats have more than twice the amount of kilocalories per gram than carbohydrates (9 kcal vs 4 kcal) eating too much of any type of fat can quickly increase your total kilocalorie intake. Now that you know the types of fats that are beneficial to health, we can look at the types of fats that are harmful to health. These types of fat are what we think of when we think of processed foods such as candy, chips, fast foods, etc. Saturated fats, and trans-fats are considered to be the “bad” fats. These types of fats will raise total blood cholesterol levels and contribute to clogged arteries. Saturated fats also raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol which can contribute to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (Ward, 2008).
Sources for saturated and trans-fats:
•	Cheese
•	Dairy Desserts
•	Red meats
•	Butter
•	Foods that are prepared with hydrogenated oils
The most important thing to remember when thinking about the types of fat that you want to eat is that the quality and quantity of fats matter. Lowering the amount of saturated and trans-fats and increasing the amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can be extremely beneficial for health (Fetters, 2015). Quantity also matters, keep in mind that the recommended daily allowance for fats is between 10-30% of your total daily amount of kilocalories.
Cholesterol is a thick, waxy, odorless substance found in the blood. The liver produces cholesterol and it can also be found in foods such as meat, eggs, fish, and dairy products. The body requires cholesterol to make cell walls and other essential body substances. Cholesterol cannot travel through the body by itself therefore, the liver packages it with triglycerides and other lipoproteins that deliver it throughout the body (University Health Service). Cholesterol in the body can vary depending on genetic makeup, age, sex, and can change over the course of one’s life. Cholesterol is essential to the body, but too much in the blood stream can be dangerous. Too much cholesterol increases the chances of stroke and heart disease. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) can be bad if they are present in excess amounts. These LDLs can build up inside of the arteries causing damage to the arteries and potentially blood clots. The desirable LDL level in the blood is less than 100 mg/dL (University Health Service) . A diet heavily consisting of cholesterol and saturated fat will increase the risk of plaque build up in the vessels. Ways to reduce risk of plaque build-up include: eating less than 200 mg of cholesterol a day, eating 20-30 grams of fiber daily, and by eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids (University Health Services).
Triglycerides are a fat found in the body. The body converts calories that are not being used right away into triglycerides that are stored in the body’s fat cells. Triglycerides differ from cholesterol because triglycerides are unused calories that can provide the body with energy while cholesterol is used in important bodily function such as building cells and hormones (Mayo Clinic). If one eats more calories than they burn, they could be at risk for high triglyceride levels. Triglycerides have the potential to cause plaque build-up in the arteries and lead to heart disease. The normal triglyceride level in the blood is under 150 mg/dL and anything above 200 mg/dL put one at risk for increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death (Triglycerides). It is recommended that anyone over the age of 20 should have their triglyceride levels measured by a blood test called a lipid panel (Triglycerides). If triglyceride levels are too high, they can be lowered by losing weight, eating healthier fats such as peanut oil and salmon, and exercising regularly. Sometimes triglyceride and cholesterol levels cannot be treated by lifestyle changes alone and require taking medications to keep the levels in the normal range.
6.5.4 Omega-3 Fatty Acids
[
]
Essential fats are exactly what they say they are - essential. Your body is not capable of producing these, so you must get them in your dietary intake (Harvard 2015). For humans, this includes the omega 3 (linolenic) and omega 6 (linoleic) polyunsaturated fatty acids (NAP, 2005).
To start this discussion, some key things should be noted about fatty acids in general. “Saturated” refers to fatty acids that contain no double bonds, “monounsaturated” refers to those with one double bond, and “polyunsaturated” refers to fatty acids that contain more than one double bond (Baggott, 1998). These two essential fatty acids, as mentioned, are polyunsaturated. The “omega” designation, followed by the number, refers to the amount of carbons away from the omega carbon (the methyl end) that the double bond is positioned (Baggott, 1998). So omega 3 fatty acids have a double bond between the third and fourth carbon from the tail of the chain, and omega 6 fatty acids have a double bond between the sixth and seventh carbon from the tail of the chain.
Next: function. Essential fats serve many general functions in the body that are unrelated to production of energy and energy metabolism. They are a key component of cell membranes that not only promote their integrity but also affect their cell receptors (Harvard, 2015). They make hormones that regulate blood clotting, the contraction and relaxation of arteries, and inflammation of tissues in the body (Harvard, 2015). They also regulate the function of genes by regulating DNA and RNA transcription and translation (Harvard, 2015). They perform these functions largely by being elongated and converted to nonessential fatty acids.   For example, the omega 6 linoleic acid of 18 carbons is often converted to arachidonic acid of 20 carbons, an essential part of phospholipid membranes in human tissues.
Omega-3’s seem to be the most important in disease prevention and the most lacking in western diets (Harvard, 2015). In foods, these appear as alpha-linolenic acid and are later converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (NAP, 2005) in the body. These function to lower the risk of coronary heart disease and strokes by preventing arrhythmias, reducing atherosclerosis buildups, improving plasma concentrations, increasing HDL cholesterol, decreasing blood pressure, and reducing inflammation (NAP, 2005). They are found primarily in fatty, oily fish (Harvard 2015). The AMDR is currently set at 0.25g to 2.0g, (FAO/WHO, 2008) or about 0.7% of total energy intake (ISSFAL, 2015)
Omega-6’s, primarily found as linoleic acid (Christie, 2013) are more common in the west and thus less of a dietary concern, but still just as necessary.   They have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol, increase HDL cholesterol, and lower the risk of coronary heart disease (NAP, 2005). The reason these are found so commonly in western diets is due to their prevalence in vegetable oils, as well as fatty fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and dark green leafy vegetables (Harvard, 2015). A healthy intake is about 2% of the daily energy intake (ISSFAL, 2015).
While both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids are essential, the appropriate balance of both in one’s intake is particularly important. The hormones and physiological responses that they regulate tend to counter one another, thus a balance is necessary. In Western diets, omega-3’s tend to be deficient, with a ratio of 15:1 – 16.7:1, omega-6:omega-3 respectively (Simopoulos, 2002). This unbalance can promote many diseases, including heart disease, inflammatory diseases, and some cancers. (Simopoulos, 2002). A more desired ratio, somewhere around 4:1, may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease mortality as well as other disease risks (Simopoulos, 2002). This ratio may vary, however it is clear that Western diets need to up the intake of these essential omega-3’s.
Essential fatty-acids are a necessary micronutrient in everyone’s diet cross-culturally to ensure proper and efficient function of the human body’s physiological processes.

Vitamin D
7.1 Vitamin A
[
]
7.1.1 Sources
[
]
Vitamin A can come from plant or animal sources. Animal sources include liver and whole milk. Vitamin A is also added to foods like cereals. This vitamin is fat-soluble vitamin.Vitamin A has an recommended daily allowance that differs for both men and women. For females it would be 700 micrograms and for males if would be 900 micrograms.Vitamin A is an essential nutrient and, as with all nutrients, the good health of women throughout childbearing years, including pregnancy, depends on consuming ppropriate amounts and that is why you would want to focus on eating foods with the Beta-Carotene in them. The Beta-Carotene will have your body convert to vitamin A on its own. In order for an individual to obtain this amount it is advise to look to foods with significant amounts of vitamin A you will find it in fortified milk. Depending on the brand will depend on the exact amount plus you can get your calcium in at the same time. If your not a milk drinker then look to other dairy products such as fortified margarine, butter, cheese and cream. If someone doesn’t eat dairy or has an intolerance to dairy you would want to point them in the direction of eggs or liver. All of these you can find with retinol but if you want to look for those who has Beta-Carotene then you can look at spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables. For a vegetarian they can incorporate broccoli as well as deep orange fruits such as apricots and cantaloupe. Some other vegetables can include Squash, carrots, Sweet Potatoes, and raw pumpkin.Vitamin A can be found in other foods as well but to gain the most nutritional content you will want to look at fruits and vegetables that will give other nutritional content. Some people may think that it is hard to incorporate vitamin a into there diet so buy explaining where to find significant sources they will have a better chance at obtaining the recombined daily amount. But there are other options if someone does not have the means of obtaining these fresh fruits and vegetables.  Other options could include supplements such as a multivitamin. Incorporating a multivitamin would assist in also adding in meeting the recommended daily amount. With anything you need to keep in mind that there is a recommended amount and this is recommended but not limited to. You will also want to make sure not to over intake of Vitamin A because it could lead to having toxic results.
7.1.2 Functions
[
]
Vitamin A regulates the growth and differentiation of many cells and tissues. It primarily affects the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Prolonged Vitamin A deficiency results in metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, a pre cancer condition. Also controls the morphogenesis of many tissues during embryonic development.
Introduction
Vitamin A, along with vitamins D, E, and K, are fat-soluble vitamins. Carotenoids (popularly as beta-carotene) found from plant food sources act as the precursor to vitamin A with the ability to be converted to active forms of vitamin A as a retinoid, which are commonly found in animal food sources. Collectively known as retinoids, the three different forms of active vitamin A used in the body are retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid, each serving a specialized function. Retinol and retinal can convert interchangeably, however, the formation of retinoic acid cannot be reversed or reconverted back to retinal and cannot be stored in the body. Retinol, the alcohol form, supports reproduction and functions as the major transport and storage form as well. Retinal, the aldehyde form, promotes vision health and is also the intermediate form in the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid, the acid form, behaves similarly to hormones by regulating cell differentiation, growth and embryonic development.
Chief Functions:
vision
protein synthesis/cell differentiation
maintaining health of epithelial tissues
reproduction
growth regulation
Vitamin A in Vision
Vitamin A is involved with the conversion of light energy into nerve impulses which takes place at the retina. There are four different kinds of pigments located within the photosensitive cells of the retina. One of these pigment molecules are called rhodopsin; each rhodopsin consisting of the protein opsin that is bonded to a molecule of cis-retinal. As light passes through the cornea and strikes the rod cells, the rhodopsin absorbs the light, opsin is released, and retinal changes from cis to trans. This change in configuration generates an electrical impulse conveying a message to the brain. The cycle repeats as most of the trans retinal is converted back to the cis form then combined with opsin protein in order to recreate rhodopsin. Any retinal that was not converted from trans to cis may be oxidized to retinoic acid.
Vitamin A in Protein Synthesis and Cell Differentiation
The majority of the body’s vitamin A is not in the retina, aiding vision, but instead in the cells lining the body’s surfaces by promoting protein synthesis and cell differentiation. Vitamin A supports the health of epithelial tissues both outside the body as skin and inside the body as mucous membranes. Both vitamin A and beta-carotene can help protect the skin against skin damage from sunlight. Retinoids are most commonly used in the treatment of skin diseases such as skin cancer and acne. Vitamin A promotes differentiation of both epithelial cells and the goblet cells that secrete mucus thereby protecting the epithelial cells from harmful substances and organisms.
Vitamin A in Reproduction and Growth
Vitamin A participates in sperm development, embryogenesis, tissue differentiation and promotes the normal development of the fetus during pregnancy. Studies have shown that children lacking in vitamin A failed to grow.
7.1.3 Requirements
[
]
Vegetarians, young children, and alcoholics may need extra Vitamin A.
If you have certain conditions, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis, and Crohn's disease, you might also need more vitamin A.
Vitamin A is required for many systems, such as the visual, immune, and reproductive systems, in order for the human body to function properly. If humans do not meet the required the Vitamin A intake, the immune system becomes impaired and cannot stop disease from attacking the body or be converted while traveling down neural pathways to the brain to help humans see. The requirements for human Vitamin A intake, set forth by the National Academy of Sciences, have actually been decreasing over time. For example, adult men were asked to consume fifteen hundred micrograms of retinol per day in 1968. This number was decreased to one thousand micrograms per day just six years later. Currently, it is even lower than that.
The recommendations for Vitamin A intake are actually well divided into sex and age groups, as well as specific recommendations for pregnant women, lactating women, and those with liver conditions. Recommended Daily Allowances, or RDA, “are set to meet the needs of almost all (97 to 98%) individuals in a group” (2001). For infants younger than six months, the recommended daily allowance is four hundred micrograms of retinol per day. For infants between seven and twelve months, the recommended daily allowance jumps to five hundred micrograms of retinol per day. For children between the ages of one and eight, the recommended daily allowance actually drops. Children between the ages of one and three are recommended three hundred micrograms of retinol per day. Children between the ages of four and eight are recommended four hundred micrograms of retinol per day. Adolescent males between the ages of nine and thirteen are recommended six hundred micrograms of retinol per day while adolescent males between the ages of fourteen and eighteen are recommended nine hundred micrograms or retinol per day. Adolescent females between the ages of nine and thirteen are recommended six hundred micrograms of retinol per day while adolescent females between the ages of fourteen and eighteen are recommended eight hundred micrograms or retinol per day. This difference appears again between men and women between the ages of nineteen and seventy. Men between nineteen and seventy are given a recommendation of nine hundred micrograms of retinol per day while non-pregnant and non-lactating women in the same age group are recommended seven hundred micrograms of retinol per day. Pregnant and Lactating women need more retinol, as they have to pass some of the Vitamin A to the fetus or infant. Lactating women need approximately twelve hundred to thirteen hundred micrograms of retinol while pregnant women need between seven hundred fifty and seven hundred seventy micrograms of retinol.
Recommendations are expressed as retinol activity equivalents (RAE). 1 RAE is equivalent to 1 ug of retinol or 12 ug of dietary beta-carotene. International Units (IU) can also be used to report vitamin A amounts. In this case, 1UI of retinol is equal to 0.3 ug RAE and 1UI of dietary beta-carotene is 0.05 ug RAE.
7.1.4 Deficiency
[
]
Vitamin A plays an essential role in the body's immune system health, bone growth, and reproduction. Without proper intake of Vitamin A, an individual would be unable to transcript cells associated with cell differentiation and this would lead to reduced resistance to disease and growth retardation. Therefore, it is vital that humans are receiving appropriate amounts of vitamin A per day. According to the National Institutes of Health (2013), individuals over the age of fourteen need between 700 and 900 micrograms of retinal activity equivalents per day. Consequently if those needs are not met, vitamin A deficiency may result from dietary deprivation, liver disorders, or fat malabsorption. In recent studies, Semba (2008) found that vitamin A deficiency is affecting approximately 125-130 million children and roughly 7 million pregnant women in developing countries. It was also discovered that, primarily, vitamin A deficiency is found in low income countries due to prolonged dietary deprivation. Furthermore, it is commonly found in eastern and southern Asia, because rice, a staple food, lacks nutritional β-carotene. Other causes of vitamin A deficiency have been linked to celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis, and bile duct obstruction (Johnson YEAR).
Since this vitamin is fat soluble, the body stores it when intake is high and is able to use it during the following weeks, months or even years. This means that intake can be adequate as long as the average daily intakes meet the recommendations. Only chronic vitamin A deficiency will lead to the existence of symptoms. Part of the metabolic pathways used by retinol are also used by other drugs, leading to many drug interactions.
In fact, scientists using mice and baboons to model alcoholism found that regardless of vitamin A intake and absorption, alcohol was able to deplete liver stores of vitamin A.
Increased alcohol intake not only decreases the amount of dietary retinoids and carotenoids consumed, but also leads to the activation of derivative enzymes that break down retinol. Ethanol and retinoic acid also compete for the same precursor, leading to chronic vitamin A deficiency in those who abuse alcohol. Although supplementation is recommended for alcoholics, the toxic effects of both vitamin A and high intakes of alcohol wreck havoc on the liver and can promote carcinogenesis.
Xerophthalmia
As discussed previously, vitamin A intake is essential for many parts of the body, but mostly vision because it greatly affects the anatomy of the cornea. The component of rhodopsin, a purplish-red light-sensitive pigment found in the retina of human eyes in rod cells helps convert light impulses to nerve impulses. Therefore, if you are consuming low quantities of vitamin A, you will have a low quantity of cis retinal. With prolonged vitamin A deficiency, rod cells will no longer be able to react to dim light, eventually leading to Xerophthalmia, or abnormal dryness of the eye. Xerophthalmia may result from keratinization of the eyes caused by the thickening and drying of the conjunctivae and corneas (Johnson, 2014). In extreme cases of this deficiency, the cornea develops erosions that lead to blindness (Johnson, 2014).  Vitamin A deficiency is a serious cause of preventable childhood blindness and mortality among preschool-aged children in developing countries. According to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) (2015) just by improving a child’s vitamin A intake, you can decrease the risk of mortality by 24%. In order to prevent this deficiency an individual, young or old, should consume dark leafy greens, carrots, fish, and sweet potatoes. Through prevention by annual supplementation of vitamin A, the IAPB (2015) aims to stop childhood blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency.
Infectious diseases
In the developing world, measles kills as many as two million children every year. The severity of the illness tends to correlate with vitamin A deficiency and administering large doses reduces the risk of death from pneumonia and diarrhea. Along with protecting against measles, vitamin A supplementation also protects against malaria, lung diseases and HIV. A review of 43 studies shows that supplementation of at-risk children under the age of five decreased their mortality by 24%.
7.1.5 Toxicity
[
]
Vitamin A toxicity can occur because of two reasons; a high ingestion of vitamin A or because of a chronic condition.  When there is excess amounts of Vitamin A in the body that leads to toxic effects, it is known as hypervitaminosis A. According to the National Institutes of Health (2013), persisting symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include dizziness, nausea, skin irritation, joint pains, intracranial pressure, coma and possibly death. These symptoms are commonly caused from the use of  therapeutic retinoids or supplements often given out in low-income countries however rarely it can be caused by high dietary intake of vitamin A. After consuming too much vitamin A, tissue levels take a significant amount of time to decrease after discontinuing their intake, often causing irreversible liver damage. Even some total intakes of vitamin A seen in some medications like Accutane may cause congenital birth defects. The birth defects caused by the intakes of vitamin A in Accutane usually consisted of deformities of the eyes, skull, heat, and lungs.
The RDA for vitamin A is 700 micrograms for women and 900 micrograms for men. According to Mayo Clinic, vitamin A toxicity is a rare occurrence however those with liver disease or suffer from excessive use of alcohol are more at risk than the general population. Acute toxicity occurs at 7.500 ug RAE/kg of body weight and chronic toxicity occurs at 1,200 ug RAE/kg of body weight for 6–15 months. The Office of Dietary Supplements says that the majority of the US population reaches an adequate level of vitamin A intake however intake decreased with age which is where the use of a dietary supplement may be helpful. (Johnson, 2014)
Certain foods should be eaten in limited quantities due to their high retinoid content. For example, one ounce of beef liver contains more than three times the RDA for vitamin A. Since fat soluble vitamins are not excreted easily, over consumption of animal liver can cause vitamin A toxicity since there is a high level of vitamin A in liver, This is especially dangerous for pregnant mothers and their unborn babies. Beta-carotene from fruits and vegetables does not pose the same risk because it is not converted into retinol efficiently enough, although it may turn the skin yellow due to accumulation of the vitamin in subcutaneous fat. Overconsumption of beta-carotene from supplements, however can be harmful because it acts like a pro-oxidant: promoting cell division and destroying vitamin A. Vitamin A is also part of the bone remodeling complex and participates in the dismantling process, removing the parts of the bones that are not needed. This process can be overactive if a person is consuming too much vitamin A from supplements.
Signs and Symptoms
Symptoms of acute vitamin A toxicity include drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased pressure on the brain. Symptoms of chronic vitamin A toxicity include blurry vision or other visual changes, swelling of the bones, bone pain, poor appetite, confusion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, dry, rough skin, cracked fingernails, mouth ulcers, jaundice, hair loss, osteoporosis, and respiratory infection. Infants and children are most vulnerable to toxicity because they need less vitamin A since their liver stores are smaller which makes them more sensitive to overdoses. Symptoms of toxicity for infants and children include the softening of the skull, bulging of the fontanel (in infants), double vision, bulging eyeballs, an inability to gain weight. Other possible complications of excess vitamin A include liver damage, excessively high calcium levels, kidney damage due to high calcium, and failure to thrive in infants (Pietrangelo, 2015).
Carotenoids
In addition to preformed vitamin A called retinoids which are found in animal food sources and in supplements, there is also another type of vitamin A found in a variety of fruits and vegetables called Carotenoids. Carotenoids have not been shown to cause toxicity because it will not be converted to vitamin A when there is already an excess of vitamin A in the body. (Higdon, 2015) Although overconsumption of carotenoids such as beta-carotene from foods is not harmful, it may turn the skin yellow (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
Vitamin A and Pregnancy
Both vitamin A excess and deficiency are known to cause birth defects. During fetal development, retinoic acid is critical for the development of the heart, eyes, ears, lungs, as well as limbs and visceral organs (“Vitamin A”, 2015). Excessive vitamin A during pregnancy leads to abnormal cell death in the spinal cord, increasing the risk of birth defects such as spina bifida and cleft palate. In these cases, vitamin A is considered a teratogen (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). During pregnancy, it is suggested that women do not receive their recommended vitamin A intake through a supplement but rather through proper nutrition. The only time it is recommended to take a vitamin A supplement is if night blindness and vitamin A is deficiency is prominent in your area. (WHO, 2015)
Treatment
The simple, most effective way to treat hypervitaminosis A is to stop taking high-dose vitamin A supplements.

7.2 Vitamin D
[
]
Introduction
[
]
Vitamin D has been traditionally known as anti-ricketic factor or sunshine vitamin.
Vitamin D is unique because it is a vitamin synthesized by the body and it functions as a hormone.
Besides its pivotal role in calcium homeostasis and bone mineral metabolism, vitamin D endocrine system in now recognized to sub-serve a wide range of fundamental biological functions in cell differentiation, inhibition of cell growth as well as immunomodulation.
It is a steroid that regulates complex system of genomic functions and has a role in prevention of neo plastic transformation.
Recent evidences from genetic, nutritional and epidemiological studies link vitamin D endocrine system with diseases  like hypertension, myopathic disorders, and proneness to infection, autoimmune disorders and cancer.
Vitamin D modulates the transcription of cell cycle proteins which decrease cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation  of a number of specialized cells of the body (osteoclastic precursors, enterocytes, keratinocytes.
Vitamin D is not an essential nutrient, even though it is considered a vitamin, it is more of a hormone. Vitamin D needs to be activated in order for it to function. This can be done one of two ways either by UV radiation from the sun or through consumption of foods. Given a good amount of time in the sun, vitamin D can be synthesized without it being directly derived from food (Whitney 11.2). This process of synthesizing vitamin D from the sun can be seen in the epigenetics of humans. Since Paleolithic time, there has been potential change in vitamin D. During this era, people lived outside and did not wear any clothing to block their skin from the sun. So what exactly is the difference between the amount of sunlight we received before compared to now? Sun exposure is a necessary factor to activate the vitamin D cholesterol but the exact amount of UV sunlight that is necessary is not clear. It is said that five to fifteen minutes of sun exposure three times a week to the face, arms, legs, or back may be all that is needed to absorb a suitable amount of vitamin D (Cleveland Clinic Health Fact Sheet). Factors that may affect the amount of sunlight necessary include age, skin color, and location. Older people, dark skinned people and those living in northern climates might need more sun exposure (Cleveland Clinic Health Fact Sheet).
7.2.1 Source
[
]
Vitamin D can be found in a small handful of foods such as:
Oily fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel, tuna)
Eggs
Powdered milk
Breakfast cereals
Fortified fat spreads (margarine)
cheese
Concentrated food sources of vitamin D include sardines, cow's milk, goat's milk, shiitake mushrooms, and eggs. Among salmon, wild-caught fish have been shown to average significantly more vitamin D than non-organically farmed fish.
As well as food, you can get vitamin D from sunlight, due to a reaction under the skin between ultraviolet light in sunlight and chemicals in the body.
The term "vitamin D" refers to several different forms of this vitamin. Two forms are important in humans: ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Vitamin D2 is synthesized by plants. Vitamin D3 is synthesized by humans in the skin when it is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from sunlight. Foods may be fortified with vitamin D2 or D3.
Forms of Vitamin D
The two major forms are vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol; vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. These are known collectively as calciferol. Vitamin D2 was chemically characterized in 1931. In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven to result from the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.(9)
Name	Chemical composition	Structure
Vitamin D1	molecular compound of ergocalciferol with lumisterol, 1:1
Vitamin D2	ergocalciferol (made from ergosterol)
Vitamin D3	cholecalciferol (made from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin).
Vitamin D4	22-dihydroergocalciferol
Vitamin D5	sitocalciferol (made from 7-dehydrositosterol)
7.2.2 Functions

Production in the skin
n the epidermal strata of the skin, production is greatest in the stratum basale  and stratum spinosum.
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is produced photochemically in the skin from 7-Dehydrocholesterol  . 7-Dehydrocholesterol is produced in relatively large quantities, 10,000 to 20,000 IU of vitamin D are produced in 30 minutes of whole-body exposure, in the skin of most vertebrate animals, including humans.(10)
7-dehydrocholesterol reacts with ultraviolet light of UVB type at wavelengths between 270 and 300 nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295 and 297 nm. These wavelengths are present in sunlight when the UV index is greater than three, as well as in the light emitted by the UV lamps in tanning beds (which produce ultraviolet primarily in the UVA spectrum, but typically produce 4% to 10% of the total UV emissions as UVB). At a UV index greater than three, which occurs daily within the tropics, daily during the spring and summer seasons in temperate regions, and almost never within the arctic circles, vitamin D3 can be made in the skin. Even if the UV index is high enough, exposure to light through windows is insufficient because UV light cannot pass through windows.
Depending on the intensity of UVB rays and the minutes of exposure, an equilibrium can develop in the skin, and vitamin D degrades as fast as it is generated.
The skin consists of two primary layers: the inner layer called the dermis, composed largely of connective tissue, and the outer, thinner epidermis. Thick epidermis in the soles and palms consists of five strata; from outer to inner they are: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Vitamin D is produced in the two innermost strata, the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.
The naked mole rat appears to be naturally cholecalciferol deficient, as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels are undetectable. In some animals, the presence of fur or feathers blocks the UV rays from reaching the skin. In birds and fur-bearing mammals, vitamin D is generated from the oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the feathers or fur and is obtained orally during grooming.
The Role of Vitamin D in our body
:
Vitamin D is known as a vitamin however it is actually a hormone when it is in its active form. Vitamin D contains a binding protein that transports it to the vital organs necessary, which are mainly the bones, kidneys and intestines (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). One of the major roles of Vitamin D in our body is bone health, specifically its’ assistance in the absorption of calcium and phosphorous and their blood concentrations. As these minerals are absorbed and deposited the bones in our body gradually strengthen and gain density that is vital for bone health. According to the text by Whitney in 2013, a Vitamin D sufficient diet promotes absorption from the GI tract, but Vitamin D also acts in an insufficient diet by providing the necessary minerals from other places like the kidneys and through mobilization from bones. Based on many studies, in addition to bone health, Vitamin D is also vital in preventing and treating “diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and multiple sclerosis” (Cleveland Clinic, 2015).  Vitamin D is also found to be helpful in preventing breast cancer, colon and prostate cancers. Vitamin D is equally important in regulating the immune and neuromuscular systems (DeNoon).
Vitamin D can help prevent type II diabetes which is a condition in which the body collects sugar in the blood stream. Type II diabetes typically develops after the age of 40, but can also develop sooner. Vitamin D and its role in regulating calcium can help control sugar in the blood. The pancreatic beta cells in the pancreas that produces insulin does not work well for individuals with type II diabetes. Research has shown that there are receptors in the beta cells that can only be activated by vitamin D. Therefore, it is hypothesized that vitamin D can help improve the production of insulin that allows the body to turn sugar into glucose. Furthermore, calcium helps regulate the release of insulin. Hence, sufficient levels of vitamin D increases the bioavailability of calcium, which in turn aids the emission of insulin (Chiu, 2004).
Vitamin D also helps prevent heart diseases and heart failures. Coronary heart disease occurs when blood supply to the heart is blocked and congestive heart failure is when the heart cannot pump adequate amount of blood to the body. In both cases, high levels of vitamin D can reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease. This is due to the fact that vitamin D lowers diabetes (as explained above) and high blood pressure. Vitamin D can also help reduce thickening of artery walls and respiratory infections and inflammations (Anderson, 2010).
Vitamin D also acts with our skin cells using sunlight. This occurs when specific wavelengths of ultraviolet B light from the sun attach to our skin cells, 7-dehydrocholesterol, a molecule in our skin cells, can be converted into the initial form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol (The World's Healthiest Foods). There are countless things that could effect vitamin D production so it would be hard to tell exactly how much Vitamin D can be produced though the interaction of our skin cells and sunlight. Vitamin D is also vital in the body’s immunity because it is active in the maturation of white blood cells, which assist the body in defending itself from infections. Based on recent research studies have found that respiratory infections show connections with low vitamin D (The World's Healthiest Foods). As we age, our bones get weaker over time, and many elderly individuals suffer from things like osteoporosis, bone loss and overall weakness of their muscles and this is because it is more challenging to activate Vitamin D with age.
Vitamin D can also be beneficial for the activity of genes that regulate cell growth, which in turn can be useful in treating diseases such as “metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, tuberculosis, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, macular degeneration, hypertension, and some cancers” (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). The Vitamin D hormone allows osteoblasts to produce a specific ligand, which then stimulates osteoclastogenesis that allows for bone resorption. Because of this the vitamin D plays a very vital role in “allowing individuals to mobilize calcium from bone when it is absent from the diet” (DeLuca, 2004). In summary Vitamin D has several functions, the most vital being its roles in bone healthy, immunity, skin, blood sugar, and its prevention of numerous diseases.

Mechanism of action
[
]
Calcium regulation
in the human body.
The role of vitamin D is shown in orange.
Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by monocyte- macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, defending the body against microbial invaders.
Following the final converting step in the kidney, calcitriol (the physiologically active form of vitamin D) is released into the circulation. By binding to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), a carrier protein in the  plasma, calcitriol is transported to various target organs.
Calcitriol mediates its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is principally located in the nuclei of target cells.
The binding of calcitriol to the VDR allows the VDR to act as a transcription factor that modulates the gene expression of transport proteins (such as TRPV6 and calbindin), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine.
The vitamin D receptor belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and VDRs are expressed by cells in most organs, including the brain, heart, skin, gonads, prostate, and breast. VDR activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells leads to the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and to the maintenance of bone content.(
)
Vitamin D increases expression of the hydroxylase gene in adrenal medullary cells. It also is involved in the biosynthesis of neurotrophic factors, synthesis of nitric oxide synthase, and increased glutathione levels.(
)
The VDR is known to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Vitamin D also affects the immune system, and VDRs are expressed in several white blood cells, including monocytes and activated T cell and B cells.(
)
Apart from VDR activation, various alternative mechanisms of action are known. An important one of these is its role as a natural inhibitor of signal transduction by hedgehog (a hormone involved in morphogenesis).(
)
One of the most important roles of vitamin D is to maintain skeletal calcium balance by promoting calcium absorption in the intestines, promoting bone resorption by increasing osteoclast number, maintaining calcium and phosphate levels for bone formation, and allowing proper functioning of parathyroid hormone to maintain serum calcium levels. Vitamin D deficiency can result in lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of reduced bone density (osteoporosis) or bone fracture because a lack of vitamin D alters mineral metabolism in the body.(
)  Thus, although it may initially appear paradoxical, vitamin D is critical for proper bone formation despite its role as a potent stimulator of bone resorption.(
)
7.2.3 Requirements
[
]
The recommended daily allowance of vitamin d for adults over 50 years is 400-800 i.u.
For people aged 25–50 years the recommended daily allowance of vitamin D is 400 i.u.
In order to maintain a healthy level of vitamin d you need consume the sorts of food that contain it such as fatty fish, eggs, milk and cereal. Also by exposing your body to the sunlight for 15 minutes for 2–3 days a week you can make your body satisfied on the amount of vitamin d you have consumed through the skin.
CHANGING  DEFINITIONS OF VITAMIN D STATUS
Based on the study of bio markers like PTH and intestinal calcium absorption and functional health outcomes, there has been a dramatic change in the definition of vitamin D deficiency over last few years. Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP)  in 1997 defined vitamin D deficiency in infants and children as a serum 25 (OH) D level below 11 ng/mL
but level below 20 ng/mL are now considered insufficient . Table I shows the classification of vitamin D status based on serum 25 (OH) D level . IOM recently published a review
on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D. This review expressed that, as studies regarding
non-skeletal health benefits provided mixed and inconclusive results, as yet there is insufficient evidence to recommend higher levels of serum 25(OH)D. It feels that benefits for most in the population is associated with levels of approximately 20 ng/ml and  use of higher   cut-off s would artificially increase the estimates of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. This review has taken skeletal health as the basis for Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). There is an urgent need to follow these current definitions of vitamin D status, as paediatricians (and obstetricians) are blamed for being a little slow to address the suboptimal vitamin D status of their patients.

Vitamin D can be obtained two ways either from sun exposure, as discussed before  or from foods. Vitamin D starts out inactive as 25-hyrdoxyvitamin D, it is then hydroxylated through two processes to make it into a usable form for the body. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver where vitamin D is converted to calcidiol. The second process of hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and it activates it into the hormone we use known as calcitriol. The best way to figure out how much vitamin D is necessary for the body is by looking at the serum concentration. According to the Vitamin D Health Fact Sheet, a serum concentration of 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status(National Institutes of Health). This serum concentration represents the status of vitamin D in our body, the amount of vitamin D that we absorb from the sun and foods. It is tested through our blood and it helps us know if we have enough vitamin d in our body to carry out certain functions such as metabolic functions. The serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are reported in nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). According to the table of: Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] Concentrations and Health, any levels over 30 nmol/l but less than 12 nmol/l lead to rickets in young children and osteomalacia in adults. The adequate levels of serum for bone and overall health in healthy individuals is between 20 -50 nmol/l (National Institutes of Health).  Relating back to the Paleolithic era, this is when the naked ape hypothesis came to be. It demonstrated that the requirement for a certain 25(OH)D concentration circulating in our body was fixed into our genes during a time when we were constantly exposed to the sun.. This genome was optimized through Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The levels of 25(OH)D occurred in UV-rich conditions that can now be seen in people that spend most of their time outdoors under the hot sun. It seems to be that the concentration of the serum 25(OH)D was  affected by the evolution of us losing fur and gaining clothing and changing from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles.
7.3.4 Deficiency
[
]
Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by not eating enough food high in vitamin d or not enough sunlight exposure. When this happens the chances of getting rickets gets increased. Rickets is a disorder where the bones become soft and weak and then begin to bow.
The sorts of people who suffer most with vitamin d deficiency would be:
•	Those who live in areas with very little sunlight
•	Work in doors during the day
•	Are a vegetarian
•	Lactose intolerant
•	Do not have milk products in their diet
Rickets and osteomalacia are classic vitamin D deficiency diseases. In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, which results in skeletal deformities. In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, which results in muscular weakness in addition to weak bones. Populations who may be at a high risk for vitamin D deficiencies include the elderly, obese individuals, exclusively breastfed infants, and those who have limited sun exposure. Also, individuals who have fat malabsorption syndromes (e.g., cystic fibrosis) or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease) are at risk.
http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vitamin-d/NS_patient-vitamind
Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African Americans and Latinos; (the pigment melanin reduces the skin’s ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency). Other cases are when the kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form as people age, their kidney are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing their risk to vitamin D deficiency.
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and its synthesis in the body is dependent on multiple factors like latitude, atmospheric pollution, clothing, skin pigmentation and duration and time of exposure to sunlight. The FAO/WHO Expert Consultation5 states that in most locations of the world between 42° N and 42°S latitude there is abundant sunshine. This is responsible for physiological production of Vit D endogenously in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol present in the subcutaneous fat. Thirty minutes of exposure of the skin over the arms and face to sunlight, without application of sunscreen, preferably between 10 am to 2 pm (as maximum ultraviolet B rays are transmitted during this time) daily is adequate to avoid Vitamin D deficiency.
In order to treat the vitamin d deficiency you need to replace it by including it in your diet and by exposing yourself to the sunlight or supplements can be given. If this problem isn't sorted out promptly then the chances of rickets, bone pain, deformities and impaired growth are greater.
Other recommendations from the Institute of Medicine for vitamin D supplementation suggest 200 IU of vitamin D daily from birth through age 50 years, 400 IU/d for individuals age 51 to 70 years, and 600 IU/d for those age 70 years or older. These recommendations presume some sun exposure and vitamin D intake from food and are not adequate to treat vitamin D deficiency.
7.2.5 Toxicity
[
]
Toxicity
Vitamin D toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis D, occurs when you have too much vitamin D in your system. Vitamin D is present in foods and is commonly synthesized in the skin using sunlight. However, vitamin D toxicity is usually the result of taking high doses of vitamin D supplements. This is largely due to the fact that the body is able to regulate the levels of vitamin D produced from sunlight and vitamin D is only naturally present in very few foods.
Beginning symptoms include vomiting, nausea, and weight loss. Excess Vitamin D can later result in calcification. Calcification is the buildup of calcium in the blood which can lead to high levels of calcium in the tissue, bone and vascular system.  Calcification can also cause high blood pressure and kidney damage as the kidney attempts to excrete excess calcium through urination.
Diagnosis for toxicity includes measuring serum Ca levels weekly, then monthly in the later process. Once diagnosis has been determined, vitamin D intake will be stopped and the patient will be treated with IV normal saline hydration. Bone resorption inhibitors such as corticosteroids or bisphosphonates will also be used to reduce calcium levels in the blood.
when some one has consumed too much vitamin d  it can cause very high calcium in the blood which in turn can cause kidney damage. There are a number of signs and symptoms that go with this which are:
•	Constipation
•	Decreased appetite
•	Vomiting
•	Dehydration
•	Fatigue
There are tests which can confirm the diagnosis such as blood tests and X-rays.
Assessment of Vitamin D
In the past measurement of serum vitamin D was limited by methodological differences (issues)17-19. With the evolution of 125I  radioimmunoassay (RIA) for estimation serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] the methodological differences have vanished (disappeared) permitting an inter-laboratory comparison of the values. [The currently available assays have antibodies cospecific to both 25(OH)
D2 and 25(OH)D3 and hence the terminology 25(OH)D assays are used. The laboratory normally estimates 25(OH)D levels and not 25(OH)D2 or 25(OH)D3].18-24 These advancements are limited by improper definition of vitamin D deficiency and hypovitaminosis D.
Assessment of serum 25(OH)D requires a blood test, a procedure not routinely ordered by healthcare providers. Vitamin D status is declining (Looker et al.,2008), so it is important that testing be implemented when appropriate.
A noninvasive screening tool could help determine the need for serum 25(OH)D testing,but currently, no validated, reliable, multi-item vitamin D screening tool exists that is intended for self-administration in community health/wellness settings.
The only way to treat it is to stop taking in so much vitamin D and go and visit your GP as they can advise any further steps in treatment.

7.3 Vitamin E
[
]
7.3.1 Sources
[
]
Common sources for Vitamin E include vegetable oils, like canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, olive oil, corn oil, and wheat germ oil. 1 tablespoon of wheat germ oil provides 100% daily value for Vitamin E. (NIH, 2013) Sunflower seeds,  almonds, peanuts, and hazelnuts are also good sources of Vitamin E. Some fruits and vegetables also contain Vitamin E, including spinach, broccoli, tomato, kiwi, and mango.
Vitamin E consists of eight different types: alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and delta-tocopherol, as well as alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, and delta-tocotrienol, and each type has its own activity within the body (Mayo Clinic, 2013). Alpha-tocopherol is the most active and most popular form of vitamin E in both natural and supplemental forms, and it is referred to as “d-alpha-tocopherol” on nutrition labels of foods and supplements. On the other hand, vitamin E is referred to as “dl-alpha-tocopherol” when manufactured in the laboratory as man-made, or synthetic, vitamin E. However, due to the fact that natural alpha-tocopherol has a higher potency than synthetic alpa-tocopherol, a person would need to consume more synthetic alpha-tocopherol to reap the same benefits of a designated amount of natural alpha-tocopherol (NIH, 2011).
Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally found in four types of food Vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and green leafy vegetables (Evert, A). Most known vegetable oils that contain Vitamin E are wheat germ, soya bean oil, and sunflower oil. Example of nuts that have Vitamin E is almonds, and peanuts. Famous seeds that contain vitamin E are sunflower seeds. In addition, green leafy vegetables like spinach and broccoli contain vitamin E. It can also can be found in synthesized food like fortified cereal, and fruit juice (Evert, A). The richest food containing vitamin E is wheat germ oil (Evert, A).. Vitamin E is lost from food in storage slowly over time. For example, wheat flour loses 33% of it vitamin after one year of storage( BRIGELIUS-FLOHÉ, R., & TRABER)..
7.3.2 Functions
[
]
Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant in the body. Free radicals can cause damage to cells, tissues, and organs. Free radicals are unstable and without one electron, the way they work is by taking a electron from a molecule or a structure, thus leaving it without an electron, making it unstable and changing its function to that of a free radical. Vitamin E stops free radicals from making this damage to the body, by donating one of their electrons to the free radical, thus stopping it from causing any more damage. When Vitamin E gives away its’ electron, it becomes inactive. Doing this stops the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Because of its’ role as an antioxidant, some evidence suggests that Vitamin E may protect against hypertention and cardiovascular disease. However, this is shown through a diet of Vitamin E rich foods, as opposed to Vitamin E supplements. (Tangney, 1996)
Years of research has discovered that vitamin E plays important roles as an antioxidant and as a defense mechanism in your immune system. This fat-soluble vitamin helps protect your cells and tissues against damage from free radicals, compounds with an unshared electron that form from daily metabolic processes. Due to their energetic and unstable nature, they seek to react with any other compound to gain an extra electron. Therefore, they can be blamed for different types of cancer, DNA damage, and blood clots that could lead to a heart attack. In response, Vitamin E donates an electron to the free radical allowing it to become more stable and ending the electron-stealing chain reaction. Accumulating studies suggest that vitamin E may lower the risk of heart disease by defending low-density lipoproteins (LDL) against oxidation and lessening inflammation. The oxidation of LDL and inflammation has been associated as key players in the development of heart disease. However, Vitamin E has yet to be proven to prevent cancer, heart disease, dementia, and stroke. Furthermore, it protects and enables the longevity of red blood cells, protects lipids (cell membranes, nervous tissues, and lipoproteins) and helps prevent the destruction of other antioxidants, such as vitamin A and C, from oxidation.
In addition, Vitamin E is very beneficial for skin health. It rejuvenates the skin, promotes healing and reduces the risk of scar tissue developing. It has also been reported to assist with eczema, skin ulcers, cold sores and shingles. Skin is exposed to various environmental elements such as ultraviolet light, having detrimental effects such as skin thickening, wrinkling, edema, erythema and an elevated risk of skin cancer. While Vitamin E can absorb UVB light, it cannot absorb UVA light or light in higher wavelengths of the UVB spectrum and has no effect on the prevention of skin cancers. Also, studies have found a connection between oral supplementation of both Vitamin E and Vitamin C and decreased DNA damage following UV exposure. Application of a topical containing both vitamins before UV exposure has been shown (in animal and human studies) to lower the amount of sunburned cells, lessen DNA damage, hinder erythema, and reduce skin pigmentation following UV exposure. Vitamin E and similar oils have been reported to enhance skin moisture, but data supporting these claims is inconclusive and limited at this time. Oral intake of vitamin E may not provide sufficient skin protection but co-supplementation with vitamin C is more likely to significantly increase the photoprotection of skin by the diet. However, topical vitamin E has been observed to be an effective means of both transport to the skin and manifestation of a photoprotective effect.
Vitamin E works as antioxidant. It protects body cells, organs, and tissues from free radical damage. Free radicals are unstable compounds with unshared electron that seek an electron to become more stable. Free radicals end up borrowing the electron from the surrounding environment like cells, organs, and tissues(vitamin E, Harvard). Damaging cells and making them unstable in the process. Antioxidants like vitamin E and selenium donate their own electron instead to the free radical, protecting the surrounding environment in the process. Free radical damage has been connected to many issues like cancer, aging, and cardio vascular disease. Vitamin E supplementation was thought of as a promising cure. However, recent studies have been controversial where both negative and positive effects were seen from using Vitamin E supplements. For example, HOPE, a study that found people who have heart disease that took vitamin E supplementation for 4 years had a higher chance of heart failure(vitamin E, Harvard). Whereas, in another study when Vitamin E supplement were given to healthy people it was linked to 24% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (vitamin E, Harvard). At last, a study found no effect of vitamin E supplementation to cardiovascular disease. Which lead the scientist to come up with a conclusion that Vitamin E has potential benefits only in certain subgroups. Same controversial findings are found with cancer (vitamin E, Harvard).
Other than being an antioxidant, Vitamin E also helps keep the strength of the immune system. it In addition, it is involved in cell signaling. Vitamin E interacts with body use of vitamin K. Therefore, it has a role in the formation of red blood cell and clotting.

7.3.3 Requirements
[
]
The dietary requirements are for the alpha-tocopherol form of Vitamin E only, because alpha-tocopherol is the only form of Vitamin E that is kept in the body. The Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) for Vitamin E in adults is 15 mg per day. The RDA for males and females are the same, unless the female is lactating, then the RDA increases to 19 mg per day. The Upper Level (UL) of Vitamin E for adults is 1000 mg per day.
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for Vitamin E is actually for a specific type of vitamin E called alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E, National institute). Vitamin E is a group name for 8 fat-soluble compounds (Vitamin E, National institute). In which alpha-tocopherol is part of the 8, it has the highest biological activity, and is the only one retained in the plasma (BRIGELIUS-FLOHÉ, R., & TRABER,). The RDA differs according to gender, and age. RDA for adults 15+ is 15 mg for genders (Vitamin E, National institute). Whereas, the RDA for 9 to 13 years old children is 11 mg for both genders (Vitamin E, National institute).
7.3.4 Deficiency
[
]
Vitamin E deficiency is very rare. People with fat malabsorption diseases, like cystic fibrosis and Chron’s disease are more likely to develop a vitamin E deficiency. Malabsorption disease prevents the bowel to absorb nutrients or pertinent fluids.  Lack of absorption prevents Vitamin E from doing its’ job- stabilizing free radicals as part of the antioxidant process. Vitamin E deficiency can cause erythrocyte hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break open, due to the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty-acids in the cell’s membrane. Vitamin E deficiency can cause muscular and neurological problems, anemia, and retinopathy. Treatment is usually Vitamin E supplementation.
Recent studies have shown that many Americans do not usually consume enough vitamin E, and specific populations who may not be getting enough vitamin E due to their general diet patterns include Hispanics and Non-Hispanic blacks, children between 4 and 18 years old, adults above 51 years old, and those who are clinically diagnosed as obese (Vitamins and Minerals, 2007). However, most people do not visibly display specific physical signs of vitamin E deficiency and may seem healthy otherwise.
Although severe vitamin E deficiency is rare, research has found that many americans suffer from marginal vitamin E deficiency. According to the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III), approximately 90% of American adults do not meet the daily requirement of vitamin E. This marginal deficiency could be due to several factors. One of these factors is smoking. Research has shown that cigarette smoke causes oxidative stress due to the free radicals in the smoke.(Bruno and Traber, 2005) As the body attempts to battle these free radicals vitamin E storages are depleted as the vitamin functions as an antioxidant.
There are also some health conditions and illnesses that can contribute to deficiency of Vitamin E. For example, some infants that are born prematurely and are underweight are vitamin E deficient. One must be cautious of treating this deficency in enfants with vitamin E supplementation because it can increase the risk of infection. Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin, meaning that fat is required to absorb it. This is why people with fat-malabsorption disorders are more susceptible to deficiency. In a rare inherited disorder known as abetalipoproteinemia, people are unable to absorb dietary fat efficiently, which also leads to deficiency. People suffering from this disorder need large amounts of supplemental vitamin E. Another inherited disorder is Ataxia and vitamin E defiency, otherwise known as AVED. In individuals with AVED, the liver's vitamin E transfer protein is either defective or not present. Their deficiency is so extreme that without large quantities of supplementation, they can develop nerve damage and ultimately become unable to walk. Aside from nerve damage, severe deficiency in vitamin E can yield other neurological symptoms. These include impaired balance, myopathy or muscle weakness, and retinopathy or damage to the retina.
Deficiency Treatment for Neurological and Absorption Disorders
Research has concluded that correcting vitamin E deficiency can result in the reversal of some neurological symptoms as well as balance vitamin E levels in people with absorption disorders (Sokol, 1988). Within a 5 to 15 year span, retinal degeneration in people with abetalipoproteinemia can be stabilized by large oral doses of a vitamin E supplement. For this symptom, it is recommended to take 2 to 3 doses totaling 100 to 200 mg per day. In addition to this, 15,000 to 20,000 IU/day of vitamin A can help reverse retinal degeneration. In patients with cystic fibrosis, 5 to 10 IU/kg/day is sufficient for balancing vitamin E levels. People with absorption disorders tend to show improvement in vitamin E levels after following a daily regimen of 200 to 3600 mg.
Vitamin E deficiency is rare, and symptoms do not appear if a person is getting a little amount of vitamin E. However, in special cases deficiency is an issue. For example, low birth weight infant < 1500 grams have vitamin E deficiency (Vitamin E, National institute). Since vitamin E is fat soluble people with fat-malabsorption like abetalipoproteinemia are vulnerable for Vitamin E deficiency. They would need to consume a lot of Vitamin E than normal to meet the requirement, around 100 mg/kg (Vitamin E, National institute). Deficiency symptoms are peripheral neuropathy, Atherosclerosis, and impairment of the immune response (Vitamin E, National institute). Atherosclerosis forms because of the inability to protect LDL from free radicals. Other symptoms are Muscle weakness, and damage to the retina (Vitamin E, National institute).

7.3.5 Toxicity
[
]
Vitamin E toxicity is very uncommon, and is not usually achieved from intake from foods. However, Vitamin E toxicity can occur from excessive supplements. Excessive amounts of Vitamin E can mess up Vitamin K’s clotting ability and cause blood to thin, increasing the possibility of hemorrhage. (Kaahe, 2013)
While vitamin E is relatively harmless if consumed in excess through the diet (although unlikely), those who take vitamin E supplements should be aware of its interactions with certain medications. For example, people on anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, such as warfarin, also known as Coumadin, should consult their doctors for possible heightened risk of bleeding due to its interactions with vitamin K’s coagulation function. Also, supplemental vitamin E taken along with other antioxidant vitamins can reverse the benefits of taking statin and niacin drugs together to prevent heart complications. Lastly, vitamin E supplements can have an impact on chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment for cancer, which could have serious effects (NIH, 2011). These examples of possible negative outcomes of excess vitamin E support the fact that supplemental vitamin E is not currently recommended as a necessary addition to the diet if a person is consuming enough vitamin E through their regular diet.
However, those who are already taking vitamin E supplements or those considering taking supplements may decide to take a one-a-day multivitamin-mineral supplement as opposed to a vitamin E-only supplement. Whereas the multivitamin-mineral supplements contain an average of 30 IU (international units) per pill, vitamin E-only supplements can contain anywhere from 100 to 1,000 IU of vitamin E per pill. While both amounts are above the daily recommended amount of 22.4 IU (15 mg), the extremely high amount of vitamin E in vitamin E-only supplements that can go as high as 1,000 IU (which is well over the recommended daily upper limit of 1000 mg) is unnecessary, and there is little to no evidence for vitamin E supplements’ impact on overall health or on lowering the possibility of contracting diseases related to vitamin E deficiency (NIH, 2011).

7.4 Vitamin K
[
]
Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins that the human body needs for posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation, and in metabolic pathways in bone and other tissue.
Vitamin K, because it is fat soluble, is stored in the liver and the fat stores in the body. Vitamin K is called as such due to its German name, “Koagulationsvitamin.” It is sometimes referred to as the clotting vitamin because it activates blood clotting factors. Vitamin K is also involved in the mineralization of the bones
.
Vitamin K refers to a family of compounds , the most common consumed form being phylloquinone (vitamin K1) which is found in plants.
7.4.1 Sources
[
]
Vitamin K is found in a number of foods, including leafy greens, cauliflower and, if you consider it a food, liver. Vitamin K is available in three forms, K1 or phylloquinone, K2 or menaquionone, and K3 or menaphthone or menadione. As aforementioned, K1 is the most commonly consumed form of the vitamin. Phylloquinone can be found in plants- specifically green leafy vegetables. This includes but is not limited to broccoli, spinach, kale, Brussels sprouts and even cauliflower. K1 is also found in plant oils typically used for cooking, such as olive, canola, and soybean oils. Interestingly, phylloquinones have greater bioavailability in oil form than in raw plant form; this may, however, be slightly decreased during hydrogenation process. The amount of K1 available also depends on the amount of chlorophyll, green pigmentation produced by the plant- dark leafy green vegetables will have a greater abundance than lighter less leafy vegetables (Torbergsen et al., 2015).
Contrastingly, Vitamin K2 is most commonly synthesized in the animal gastrointestinal tract as microbacteria. K2 is also commonly found in fermented foods. Foods rich in menaquinones include beef liver and cheese products. K2 is naturally produced in the large intestine and it is believed that this compromises approximately 50 percent of the necessary vitamin K requirement of humans (Shearer, Fu, & Booth, 2012). Because this constitutes a vast majority of our requirement, upon birth, newborns are typically given a Vitamin K shot. Newborns have a sterile gut and therefore no bacteria to synthesize vitamin K. The fetus obtains vitamin K from its mother by transplacental transfer.
There is little known about Vitamin K3 except that it is found already formed in food but not in substantial doses. However, the chief source of vitamin K is synthesis by bacteria in the large intestine, and in most cases, absence of dietary vitamin K is not at all deleterious. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin and both dietary and microbial vitamin K are absorbed into intestinal lymph along with other lipids.
Vitamin K is a vitamin that can be found in multiple food sources but is also produced in the body. The GI tract contains bacteria that can synthesize vitamin K in small amounts. The specific type of Vitamin K that is produced in the GI tract this way is called menaquinone, or Vitamin K2. The rest of the Vitamin K a person needs can be obtained from the diet. Examples of foods containing quality amount of Vitamin K are spinach, kale, collards, bib lettuce, sprouts, cabbage, and other leafy greens. Some fruits and vegetable oils also have Vitamin K sources. Fruits that are a good source of Vitamin K are avocado and kiwi and a good oil source is either soybean oil or canola oil. The specific name for this kind of dietary Vitamin K is phylloquinone, or Vitamin K1. As you can see there are plenty of ways to make sure you have sufficient Vitamin K in your diet. There are also Vitamin K shots, but these are given to newborns because of their sterile GI tract being unable to synthesize Vitamin K right after birth.
7.4.2 Functions
[
]
Physiologic Effects of Vitamin K
[
]
As its nickname suggests, vitamin K is essential in blood clotting. Vitamin K activates several proteins involved in the clotting. The most notable protein that Vitamin K activates is prothrombin, the precursor to thrombin which in turn becomes fibrin that forms a solid clot. Vitamin K, reduced to Vitamin KH2, activates proteins through carboxylation of glutamic acids.
Vitamin K serves as an essential cofactor for a carboxylase that catalyzes carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on vitamin K-dependent proteins. When the carboxylation occurs proteins are able to bind to cell membranes. When binding occurs, it is likely that interaction will also occur; this interaction is what leads to clot formation.  Anticoagulation drugs, such as Coumadin and Warfarin, block Vitamin K from being reduced and therefore interrupting the cycle and inhibiting clot formation.
The key vitamin K-dependent proteins include:
proteins: factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X
Anticoagulation proteins: proteins C, S and Z
Others: bone proteins osteocalcin and matrix-Gla protein, and certain ribosomal proteins
The Vitamin K Cycle
[
]
As a cofactor to the carboxylase that generates gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, Vitamin K undergoes a cycle of oxidation and reduction that allows its reuse. The essential details of this cycle are:
Vitamin K (usually K1) is reduced to vitamin KH2.
Oxygenation of vitamin KH2 provides the energy to drive the carboxylation reaction, leading to formation of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues and vitamin K oxide.
Vitamin K oxide is reduced by another reductase back to vitamin K, ready to enter another cycle. Anticoagulants such as Warfarin block the reduction of vitamin K oxide to vitamin K, explaining their antagonistic effects on this cycle.

[
]
Vitamin K is an essential fat-soluble vitamin that is very important in blood clotting, synthesis of bone protein, and preventing hemorrhagic disease. In order to keep all of these functions in check and running properly there are recommendations and requirements that should be met daily. It is extremely important that these requirements are met and or not exceeded. If the daily recommendations are exceeded ad go over the upper limit amount it is very possible that the effectiveness of anti-clotting medications can be compromised or labeled ineffective. The adequate intake (daily recommendation) differentiates for men and women. For men, the adequate intake is 120 micrograms per day. For women, the adequate intake is about 90 micrograms per day.  It is also suggested that, “human dietary vitamin K requirement (for its coagulation role) of about 1mg/kg body weight/day,” (WHO), is normal.
When we are born, each and every one of us receives a single dose of vitamin K that is synthesized by the bacteria in the GI tract. The way this occurs is through, “absorption of vitamin K2 from the distal small bowel, supporting a definite role for bacterially synthesized vitamin K2 in contributing to the human nutritional requirements of this vitamin.”(American Journal of Gastroenterology). However, “the amount is insufficient to meet the body’s needs and its bioavailability is limited,” (textbook). Therefore we have to find other sources of vitamin K to keep our body’s systems functioning. You can meet these daily requirements by eating foods such as leafy green vegetables (kale or spinach), some fruit, animal liver (beef liver), or milk. If we as consumers are aware of our personal daily requirements for vitamin K then we can eat the right foods rich in that vitamin and live healthy lives.
Vitamin K is a fat soluble vitamin which means two things: that it is found in the fat and oily parts of food, and that it is stored in the liver and adipose tissue. Since vitamin K is stored in the fatty parts of our body, our bodies store it there longer. Since this essential vitamin is stored longer the daily intake and daily recommendations is not as crucial as it would be with water soluble vitamins, which are not stored as long as fat soluble vitamins. However, just because daily intake of vitamin K and other fat-soluble vitamins is not as crucial does not mean that we completely ignore their importance and the importance of consuming these vitamins and nutrients.
7.4.4 Deficiency
[
]
Vitamin K deficiency can lead to excessive bleeding, which may begin as oozing from the gums or nose. Other things that may lead to vitamin K deficiency include:
Health problems that can prevent your body from absorbing vitamin K, such as gallbladder or biliary disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease
Liver disease
Taking blood-thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin)
Long-term hemodialysis
Serious burns
Conditions that benefit from vitamin K
[
]
Excessive Bleeding
[
]
Vitamin K is used to reduce the risk of bleeding in liver disease, conditions where your body doesn' t absorb enough vitamin K, or if you taken antibiotics for a long time.
Even though vitamin K deficiency in newborns is very rare, it is dangerous enough that doctors give the injections. Newborns at greatest risk for vitamin K deficiency are premature or those whose mother had to take seizure medications during pregnancy. Mothers on seizure medications are often given oral vitamin K for 2 weeks before delivery.
Osteoporosis
[
]
Your body needs vitamin K to use calcium to build bone. People who have higher levels of vitamin K have greater bone density, while low levels of vitamin K have been found in those with osteoporosis.
There is increasing evidence that vitamin K improves bone health and reduces risk of bone fractures, particularly in postmenopausal women who are at risk for osteoporosis. In addition, studies of male and female athletes have also found that vitamin K helps with bone health. However, some studies have found that vitamin K didn' t help with bone density.
7.4.5 Toxicity
[
]
According to research, excessive intake of natural forms of Vitamin K (Vitamin K1 and Vitamin K2) is unlikely to cause toxicity symptoms (Contreras, 2007). However, another form of Vitamin K, also known as K-3 or menadione, is correlated with detrimentally toxic effects. Because of this, toxicity with the first two forms is uncommon, while there is evidence but little modern research that has investigated the toxicity of Vitamin K in the form of K-3.  With that said, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for natural Vitamin K has yet to be established (Acquilina, Costa, & Wallace, 2014).
The naturally occurring compounds of Vitamin K are K1 (Phylloquinone), and K2 (Menaquinone) (Molitor & Robinson, 1940). As mentioned before, synthetic vitamin K, a form known as K-3 or menadione, is associated with potentially toxic effects in young children, those undergoing synthetic vitamin K-3 injections, or taking supplements that specifically include menadione (Booth, Golly, Sacheck, Roubenoff, Dellal, Hamada, & Blumberg, 2004) .
Because of this, product labels may list Vitamin K-3 in these forms:
menadione sodium bisulfate
menadione sodium bisulfite
menadione dimethylprimidinol sulfate
menadione dimethylprimidinol sulfite
menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite
The ingredients named above may not be directly listed so consumers should look out for key phrases on labels such as “a source of vitamin K activity” or “Vitamin K supplement” (Contreras, 2007). With that said, consumers should be cautious because manufacturers may neglect to include the entire chemical name under ingredient lists due to the potentially toxic effects from synthetic ingredients such as menadione. For example, an ingredient might appear as dimethylprimidinol sulfate instead of its entire chemical name, menadione dimethylprimidinol sulfate.
Natural forms of Vitamin K are fat-soluble; however, menadione derivatives are water-soluble and therefore, circumvent utilization by the body. In addition, the body cannot process menadione in its pure form, allowing it to accumulate and become toxic in the body.
Symptoms of synthetic Vitamin K-3 toxicity can include the following (Acquilina, Costa, & Wallace 2014):
fatigue
jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin and eyes)
hemolytic anemia (the destruction of red blood cells at a faster rate than the bone marrow can produce them)
hyperbilirubinemia (an excess amount of bilirubin in the blood, causing pigmentation in skin and eyes)
oral coagulants may become ineffective
interference with certain medications meant to thin the blood
These symptoms can appear even at acute toxicity levels. Acute levels of toxicity can be reached when levels exceed the daily requirements by a factor of 1000. The United States Food and Drug Administration outlawed the addition of this man-made form of Vitamin K in all over-the-counter nutritional supplements (Booth, Golly, Sacheck, Roubenoff, Dellal, Hamada, & Blumberg, 2004). Synthetic Vitamin K or menadione (K-3) is not recommended to supplement a Vitamin K deficiency. However, there is still controversy regarding the use of menadione in animal feed products due to the unconfirmed data on its supposed benefits and/or detrimental effects.
Vitamin K toxicity is very rare and not something that is overly necessary to worry about. Currently, no harmful side effects have been discovered from having very high intakes of Vitamin K. Because of this, an Upper Level of Vitamin K has not even been established. The only negative side effect that has been discovered is one that is only relevant to those who are taking anticoagulant drugs in order to prevent their blood from clotting. For those people whom this applies to, there is a chance that too much vitamin K could reduce the effectiveness of the drug. This is because one of the main functions of Vitamin K in the body is blood clotting. Appropriately, Vitamin K gets its name from the Danish word
koagulation
, which, when translated, actually means ‘coagulation’ or ‘clotting’. However, they are able to go about their lives normally and with normal diets. Their blood is monitored regularly and adjustments are made to the doses if needed.
Since the majority of Vitamin K intake comes from the diet, mainly leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, and oils, you can see why there isn’t much of a chance of getting too high levels of Vitamin K.  The other source of Vitamin K is a nonfood source in the body produced when bacteria in the GI tract synthesizes Vitamin K. However the amount produced by this is very low and once again, could never cause toxicity.

Thiamin
Riboflavin
8.1 Thiamin
[
]
Thiamin is also known as thiamine, aneurine or vitamin B1 because it was the very first B vitamin discovered. It is one of the several B vitamins that come together to form coenzymes that help in releasing energy. Thiamin is part of the B vitamins that help the body use carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The B vitamins also support the nervous system, and ensure that it functions correctly. They are water-soluble, so the body does not accumulate them. Occasionally, thiamin is considered an “anti-stress” vitamin because it can enhance the immune system and aid the body’s ability to endure stressful conditions. (University of Maryland Medical Center, 2015).
8.1.1 Sources
[
]
Thiamin is found in miniscule amounts in a various amount of nutritious foods. It is found in plants and animals, but meats in the pork family are notably rich in thiamin. Grains, whole or enriched, are also a dependable source of thiamin. Beneficial and sometimes unusual sources of thiamin are soymilk, acorn squash, and tomato juice. Other different sources are cereals, peas, beans, nuts, and watermelon. Fortified foods are often filled with thiamin that is why common products rich in thiamin include grains, milks, breads, and cereals (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2015).
Supplements are also a source of Vitamin B1. It can be found in a wide array of multivitamins, including children’s chewable vitamins, or in B complex vitamins, or it may be sold by itself. With today’s advancement in medicine, this vitamin is accessible in a wide assortment of forms including pills that you swallow, chewable tables, soft gels, and lozenges. Thiamin may also be identified as “thiamine hydrochloride” or “thiamine mononitrate.” As with all vitamin supplements, one should first check with his or her doctor before taking this supplement regularly or when distributing it to children (University of Maryland Medical Center, 2015).
8.1.2 Functions
[
]
Thiamin is the vitamin that is a part of the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) which assists in energy metabolism. This coenzyme engages in the reconstruction of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. This step is vital in allowing carbohydrate energy to go into the TCA cycle and generate more ATP than glycolysis. Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) has a critical role in energy metabolism, but it also occupies a very specific site on nerve cell membranes. Therefore, nerve activity and muscle activity both depend on the very important vitamin thiamin.
People take thiamine for various reasons. It is necessary for those with thiamine deficiencies. Illnesses associated with thiamine deficiency include beriberi and inflammation of the nerves more concisely named neuritis associated with pellagra or pregnancy. Benefits of having this vitamin in your diet include digestive regulation particularly correcting poor appetite, ulcerative colitis, and ongoing diarrhea. Thiamine is also has immune benefits and is even used in treating Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome, diabetic pain, heart disease, and other serious diseases that compromise a person’s immune system (Higdon, 2015).
Although the benefits of doing so have not been confirmed, some people use thiamine for maintaining a positive mental attitude, enhancing learning abilities, increasing energy, fighting stress, and preventing memory loss and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Healthcare providers do; however, give shots of thiamine for treating a memory disorder called Wernicke's encephalopathy syndrome, other thiamine deficiency syndromes in critically ill people, alcohol withdrawal, and comas. It has anti-stress benefits. It treats health issues associated with stress most effectively immune deficiencies.
8.1.3 Requirements
[
]
The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for thiamin that was edited in 1998 is based on the prevention of deficiency in normal, healthy, human beings. The RDA increases as an infant grows, but once adulthood is reached, it remains constant at 1.2 mg/day for males and 1.1 mg/day for women (Oregon State Institute, 2015).
Recommendations for Thiamin intake vary for children according to age. As children grow older, they require more and more thiamin. Male infants require 0.2 mg/day and adult males require 1.2 mg/day. The exceptions to this are women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. They require 1.4 mg of Thiamin per day.  (Higdon, 2000.)
In most people, the body does not absorb more that 4.5 mg of Thiamin per day, even when they consume excessive amounts orally. (Thompson, 2000).  This is why there are no reported effects of consuming too much Thiamin and there is no clear upper limit for Thiamin.  The amount of Thiamin absorbed daily differs greatly for alcoholics.  For people who are malnourished and alcohol dependent, the body absorbs about 0.8 mg of Thiamin a day when alcohol has been consumed beforehand. (Cook, 1998)
8.1.4 Deficiency
[
]
Thiamine deficiency can lead to many different health complications. Your body is incapable of storing large quantities of thiamine, so it is vital to take in thiamine through your diet (The Natural Standard Research Collaboration, 2013).
People can be predisposed to thiamine deficiencies. Some predisposing factors include, eating disorders, malnutrition, gastrointestinal surgical procedures and most commonly alcoholism (Osiezagha et al., 2013).  Alcoholism is the most common cause for thiamine deficiency in the United States due to the poor diet associated with that particular lifestyle (Evert A, 2013; Osiezagha et al., 2013). Alcohol is also known to compromise thiamine absorption from the gastrointestinal tract which also can impair thiamine storage (Osiezagha et al., 2013).
Some common symptoms of thiamine deficiency include headache, nausea, fatigue, irritability, depression, weakness, psychosis, nerve damage, and abdominal discomfort (Ehrlich S, 2013; Evert A, 2013). There are also many health problems associated with this deficiency, as mentioned before. Some common diseases associated with thiamine deficiency are Wernicke’s disease, Korsakoff syndrome, cataracts, Alzheimer’s disease, heart failure, beriberi, cancer, severe obesity, delirium, and systemic diseases (Ehrlich S, 2013; Evert A, 2013; Osiezagha et al., 2013).
Severe thiamine deficiency can lead to brain damage. Wernicke’s disease causes damage to nerves in the central nervous system as well as the peripheral nervous system (Ehrlich S, 2013; Evert A, 2013) This disease is often caused through malnutrition and alcoholism which then lead to thiamine deficiency (Ehrlich S, 2013). The Korsakoff syndrome can cause memory problems and nerve damage (Ehrlich, 2013). Beriberi is also a common disease with those with severe thiamine deficiency (Ehrlich S, 2013).
There are not many treatments to thiamine deficiency except to get medical attention immediately. Thiamine should be immediately supplied to the body through either intravenous or intramuscular ways to ensure an abundant amount of thiamine is being absorbed (Osiezagha et al., 2013). Treating thiamine deficiency with thiamine can help cure or lighten the severity of the disease. Although, this is not true for all diseases associated with thiamine deficiency. Some diseases have no improvement with thiamine being added to the body (World Health Organization, 1999). Another form of treatment is through thiamine or vitamin B-complex supplements (WHO, 1999). One downside to these supplements is that it is difficult to organize, expensive, and can be ineffective in the long term, as these are needed to be taken daily (WHO, 1999). The use of these tablets to treat thiamine deficiency should be only for outbreaks of thiamine deficiency diseases or to pregnant and lactating women (WHO, 1999).
There are also numerous ways to prevent your body from a thiamine deficiency disease. If your body is predisposed to thiamine deficiency it is possible to get preventative therapy (WHO, 1999). It is recommended that the therapy should continue for more than two weeks (WHO, 1999). Whether your body is predisposed or not, diversifying your diet can help to make sure you are eating more foods that have thiamine in them (WHO, 1999).  Reducing the intake of anti-thiamine factors in your diet can also aid in preventing thiamine deficiency (WHO, 1999).

8.1.5 Toxicity
[
]
Thiamine is more commonly known as Vitamin B1. It was given the name because thiamine was the first B complex vitamin to be discovered (Bradford, 2015). According to the Mayo Clinic, it was also one of the first vitamins of any type to b classified No know levels of thiamine have been identified. There is no upper limit to the amount of vitamin B1 that can be consumed. Vitamin B1 is water soluble thus if a person has an excess thiamine in there system, it is easily excreted in urine. The possibility of hypersensitivity to thiamine is; however, possible, but it is simply accompanied by fatigue and drowsiness.
Recommended daily value of Thiamin is 1.1 milligrams a day for women and more if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. For men, the recommended daily value is 1.2 milligrams a day (Whitney, 2013). There is, however, no specified upper limit to the amount that can be taken before toxicity. Thiamin has many sources in a diet the most prevalent being in whole grains, legumes, and pork. The most common form of rice eaten today is white rice which is not a whole grain. Instead, it is a polished down grain. In the process of doing so, the thiamin that naturally occurs in the grain is also stripped away. Because of this stripping, white rice is enriched, or fortified, with thiamin. Because of the over processing of many foods, thiamin is an oft enriched vitamin.

8.2 Riboflavin
[
]
8.2.1 Sources
[
]
Riboflavin can be found in a large variety of different foods. Legumes, vegetables, and seafood all contain significant amounts of riboflavin. While these products do contain substantial quantities of riboflavin, they are typically not the most riboflavin dense foods. One of the richest sources of riboflavin are milk products. One cup of 2% fat milk satisfies 29% of one’s daily value recommended intake of riboflavin. One cup of plain yogurt fulfils 35% of one’s daily value recommended intake of riboflavin. To compare, one cup of kidney beans meets only 6% of the daily value and three ounces of salmon satisfy merely 12% of one’s daily value recommended intake (USDA, 2014).
Aside from milk products, there are many other rich sources of riboflavin. The milling process of refined grains result in a significant loss of riboflavin. However, the enrichment process of fortified grains make products like breakfast cereal and bagels some of the best sources of riboflavin. One serving of some fortified breakfast cereal can satisfy 100% of one’s daily value recommended intake of riboflavin. To a lesser extent, whole grain/wheat products are also a great sources of riboflavin. The riboflavin density of whole grain/wheat foods is typically less extreme than fortified foods because nutrient compositions aren’t artificially modified. Nonetheless, their contribution to one’s daily value of riboflavin can still be quite significant with a single slice of whole wheat bread containing 6% of one’s daily value of riboflavin (USDA, 2014).
Another excellent source of riboflavin is red meats. A three ounce piece of grilled beef satisfies roughly 24% of riboflavin daily value and a three ounce cut of lamb fulfils 105% of daily riboflavin intake. One of the largest known sources of riboflavin is beef liver. Cattle liver is one of the most nutrient dense foods in general, and riboflavin is no exception. A three ounce piece of cattle liver contains nearly 170% of one’s daily value of riboflavin (USDA, 2014).
Riboflavin is a water soluble vitamin and vulnerable to inactivation when exposed to ultraviolet light (Kumar, 2004). For this reason, sources of riboflavin must be stored in opaque containers and away from the sun in order to prevent riboflavin loss. Riboflavin isn’t completely fragile, its stability as a vitamin is actually quite strong. It can endure exposure to relatively extreme heating conditions and normal cooking processes (Choe, 2005). For these reasons, it is only important to be concerned over the storage of a riboflavin source as it relates to ultraviolet light.

8.2.2 Functions
[
]
The water-soluble vitamin Riboflavin, also known as B2, functions in energy metabolism, as an antioxidant, as a coenzyme in many areas, and in redox reactions. Like other B vitamins, riboflavin helps the body convert carbohydrates, fats and proteins into glucose for fuel for the body. In energy metabolism riboflavin is in its coenzyme forms of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and functions as a hydrogen/electron carrier. Riboflavin also works in combination with some other B vitamins, B6 and folate, in a process in the body that changes these into useable forms. Riboflavin is essential in growth processes and red blood cell production as well.
The electron transport chain is explained in a series of five complexes, of those complexes FMN functions in complex I and FAD in complex II. In the electron transport chain, FAD serves as an electron carrier and accepts electrons to become FADH2. FADH2 then gives its electrons to complex II of the chain that forms ATP molecules that act as energy.
Riboflavin also serves as an antioxidant that is used as a defense by the body to neutralize free radicals and prevent them from multiplying and causing cell and DNA damage. Antioxidants donate electrons to the unstable free radicals making them neutral and therefore unable to harm the body.
Because of its vital functions, riboflavin has medical implications and is used in an attempt to treat some ailments. Riboflavin supplementation may be beneficial in the treatment of migraine headaches, riboflavin deficiency, high homocysteine levels, and cataracts.
• Migraines: Riboflavin cannot reduce the pain or duration of the migraine but may be effective if taken at 400 mg/day in reducing the number of migraine headaches.
• High homocysteine: People who suffer from hyperhomocysteinemia, or high amount of homocysteine in the blood, may find taking supplemental riboflavin to be beneficial in lowering the levels. Some people are unable to convert homocysteine into the functioning amino acid form methionine used by the body and therefore suffer from high levels of homocysteine in the blood. Taking riboflavin has shown in studies to help lower homocysteine blood levels in people with this condition.
• Cataracts: Because of riboflavin’s function as a coenzyme in bodily processes it has been seen as an effective supplement in the reduction of cataracts. Riboflavin, in combination with    the other B vitamins, helps to promote healthy vision and without all the B vitamin components, vision processes will be impaired. Because the combination of B vitamins is needed for normal vision, riboflavin supplementation will be most useful in combination with a niacin supplement in reducing a person’s chance of developing cataracts.
8.2.3 Requirements
[
]
The water soluble vitamin, riboflavin or vitamin B2 is essential for many of the body functions as mentioned earlier. It is important to know how much of the vitamin is recommended on a daily or weekly basis for the normal body functions. As the recommendations for each vitamin or nutrients vary, for riboflavin the Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA varies for each age group and gender. For infants who are 0 to 6 months old, the RDA is .3 milligrams every day and for infants who are 7 to 12 months old, the amount increases to .4 milligrams per day. There is a steady increase in the intake amount for Riboflavin as the age increases. For children from ages 1 to 3 years, the RDA is 0.5 milligram per day. From ages 4 to 8, the amount is 0.6 milligrams per day. Children between the ages 9 and 13, the RDA is 0.9 milligrams per day. From this point is when the amount of Vitamin B2 changes with age and gender. For males who are 14 years or older, they require about 1.3 milligrams per day. Females between the age range of 14-18 are required to have 1 milligram every day. Unlike males, females who are 19 years and older have a requirement of 1.1 milligrams to have every day. There are specific requirements of Vitamin B2 intake for the pregnancy period and the lactation period. When a female is pregnant, the RDA increases to 1.4 milligrams per day. While, when females lactate, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 1.6 mg/day.
	These values are based on the enzymatic activity in the erythrocytes or red blood cells and the urinary excretion. Since riboflavin is considered as a coenzyme in its function, there is approximately 90% of flavin found in the coenzymes. Riboflavin is measured as erythrocyte flavin which are hydrolyzed. With the help of the High Performance Liquid Chromatography or HPLC, separation of this vitamin from other flavin compounds gives a more detailed result of the concentration of riboflavin in the red blood cells. Similarly, urinary riboflavin is also used to help determine the amounts of vitamin B2 that is required for a specific body type, in terms of gender and age. Research provides that the amount of riboflavin excreted in terms of creatinine levels, is higher in children than of adults. This can prove why the amount of intake for riboflavin varies by age. The level of excretion of riboflavin decreases as a person ages, which proves that there is more quantity of riboflavin in children than in adults. Hence, as children age, they require more riboflavin intake.
8.2.4 Deficiency
[
]
Riboflavin Deficiency:
As stated earlier riboflavin, or vitamin B2, is fundamental in the process of metabolism in all of the macro-nutrients. More specifically it plays an important role during the step of energy release from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This same energy is what is used to contract muscles, power cells, generate new cells, and fight off bacteria. Based on this knowledge, it is clear to see that a deficiency in riboflavin would be completely detrimental for overall health. Some of the symptoms that would mark a riboflavin deficiency include:
-Pale Skin
-Bloodshot eyes
-Sensitivity to light
-Fatigue
-Itching and burning of the eyes
-Oily skin
-Dull hair
-Sore tongue
-Cracked lips
-Premature Wrinkling
-Inflammation in the mouth
-Split Nails
-Lesion formation
Organ failure will begin with the adrenal glands, which secrete and metabolize hormones with enzymes. These hormones spur on many major bodily functions.  Without the energy to drive or make more enzymes, the adrenal gland fails to dispense out hormones in the bloodstream. Vitamin B2 deficiency is commonly linked to alcoholism, dietary inadequacy, and people with blood disorders.
The most common of the causes is dietary inadequacy. Kwashiokor and Marasmus disease, in which there is insufficient protein and energy intake, the individual may lack in essential B vitamins. This includes riboflavin as described by Dr. Von Castel-Roberts. Vitamin B2 is common in plants and animals for necessary basic biological function. When we consume them, we absorb all of their vitamin B levels as well. This is due to that the entire food chain begins with plants which is consumed by animals and eventually consumed by humans. Humans can either take in the B2 through consumption of the animal or the plant.  Regardless, riboflavin is not a scarce vitamin in everyday life.
There are groups of individuals identified to have insufficient levels of riboflavin. Watch out for elderly folks whose primary source of caloric intake is tea and toast.  People with infections, liver disease, or are severe alcoholics are also prone to deficiency.
Vitamin B2 supplements should be taken in quick response to low levels to keep important bodily functions going.  The daily recommended dietary allowance is 1.3 mg for adult men, 1 mg for adult women, 1.1 mg for pregnant women, and 1.6 mg for breastfeeding women. For adults with low levels of riboflavin, treatment dosage should be at least 5 mg daily and no more than 30 mg daily, all in divided doses. Simply eating at least the recommended amount of riboflavin, which can be reached by following the examples in “MyFoodPlate”, attains many benefits. Cataracts in the eyes can be prevented. Reduction of homocysteine levels in the blood can also occur by converting it into methionine.  And for serious migraine issues, taking high doses of riboflavin (about 400 mg) reduces the number of attacks.

8.2.5 Toxicity
[
]
Riboflavin is known more for its deficiencies, not for essentially being non-toxic. For instance, riboflavin wasn’t given an Upper Intake level (IU) in 1998 when the Recommended Dietary Allowance was updated. There are no known adverse or toxic effects of excess riboflavin, but there is the potential that it could increase the risk of breaking DNA strands, but only in the presence of a carcinogen called chromium (VI). In high-dose riboflavin therapy, there are cases of a harmless reaction where urine turns bright yellow or orange; this is called flavinuria.  With this B2 vitamin, even extremely high dosages have very rare side effects. While excluding flavinuria, some of these side effects can include itching, numbing sensations, and induced eye damage from the sun. This is reported by taking more than 10 mg of riboflavin per day. It should be noted that supplements usually contain 20–25 mg of B2 and 400 mg when taken at therapeutic dosages.
Typically it’s easy for us to reach very high levels of riboflavin because supplements contain levels of B2 that are beyond the daily requirements with 10 to 100s of mgs. There can be risks associated with these high levels of riboflavin in combination with other factors. B2 and the combination of light can lead to adverse reactions as well. Riboflavin in our eyes and skin contributes to the negative effects due to UV light exposure, such as connective tissue damage, induction of DNA lesions, and mitochondria impairment. In animals, research found that high doses caused cellular damage to the retina of the eye. When there is that excess riboflavin in the body, blood, tissues, and urine levels greatly increase their levels of free riboflavin. Free riboflavin is dietary riboflavin not being used in the B2 dependent enzymes.
As for drug interactions with riboflavin, women who regularly take high dose oral contraceptives were indicated diminished riboflavin status in early reports. However, the investigators who did controls on B2 intake found no differences between the female contraceptive users and non-users. Chronic consumption of alcohol has also shown to be associated with riboflavin deficiency, which was demonstrated in studies where rats were fed alcohol which led to impairment of intestinal absorption and renal uptake.
In conclusion - most reports about riboflavin stand by their argument that it is harmless in large doses and non-toxic. However, one should be aware of the contradicting reports that exist but be conscious of the interactions riboflavin has with drugs and the high levels that exist with supplementation.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Niacin
Folate
8.3 Niacin
[
]
Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, is one of the eight, water-soluble B vitamins that is involved in the metabolism of glucose, fat, and alcohol to produce energy. Niacin serves this role as an intermediate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and the phosphate form of NAD, NADP; these compounds function in helping oxidation-reduction reactions occur in the body (Higdon 2013).
Niacin is a water-soluble B3 vitamin. It encompasses both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, with the latter being the main source present in the blood. It has two coenzyme forms, which are NAD and NADP otherwise known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and the phosphate form respectively. Both function primarily in energy metabolic redox reactions of the breakdown of carbs, proteins, alcohol, and fats, serving as coenzymes to over 400 enzymes. Specifically, NAD hinders neurological degeneration and also parallels riboflavin coenzymes during metabolism as it takes hydrides from the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain (Rolfes & Whitney 2013).
Sufficient amounts of the vitamin can either be obtained from the diet or be made in the body from the amino acid tryptophan if satisfactory protein synthesis requirements have been met. Tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway is relatively inefficient in providing the recommended amounts of niacin because it also depends on certain enzyme availability along with the presence of other B vitamins such as vitamin B6 and riboflavin. Specifically, to create 1 milligram of niacin, 60 milligrams of dietary tryptophan is required. Recommendations are expressed as niacin equivalents (NE), whereby the amount of tryptophan is converted to niacin using the 60 mg standard (Harper, Henderson, & Horwitt 1981). For example, a food comprised of 1 milligram of niacin and 120 milligrams of tryptophan essentially provides the equivalent of 3 milligrams of total niacin.
Niacin is naturally found in protein-rich foods and some vegetables such as meat, fish, poultry, enriched whole grains, legumes, potatoes, tomatoes, and mushrooms. However, corn is a bad source of niacin because 70% of its niacin is connected to peptides and complex carbs that inhibit its proper absorption. In fact, several studies have been performed comparing a “corn” versus “wheat” based diet. After several weeks and urinary excretion assessments, findings show that those subjects fed a “corn” based diet developed a niacin deficiency at a much faster rate, most likely due to the low tryptophan content of corn and an inhibitory factor in corn which results in an amino acid imbalance (Gibbens, Goldsmith, Rosenthal, & Tjnglaub, 1955). RDA requirements are 16 mg NE/day for men and 14 mg NE/day for women with the maximum acceptable dosage (UL) being 35 mg/day. In some cases, large doses of nicotinic acid can be helpful as in the case of fighting heart disease. A particular study tracked the progression of increased niacin dosages over the course of several weeks and results show that total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio decreased by one-thrid. In fact, by week 96, participant LDL-cholesterol levels reduced by 20%, HDL cholesterol levels increased by 28%, and triglyceride levels declined by 40% (Brody, Brusco, Capuzzi, Goldberg, Guyton, Kreisberg, & Morgan 1998).
However, if an individual were to exceed such recommendations by abusing niacin supplements they can potentially induce harm, changing niacin’s effect in the body from being solely physiological to pharmological- a transition where by the extra amount of the vitamin acts as a drug raising blood concentrations to unusually high levels. For example, if intake of nicotinic acid exceeds 3-4 times the RDA recommendation daily dose, a niacin flush may ensue. Symptoms include headaches, reddened extremities and chest, and temporary burning, tingling, and itching sensations due to capillary dilation. In order to avoid toxicity, the use of niacin as a drug needs to be monitored and should be abstained from use as treatment in people with liver disease, peptic ulcers, inflammatory bowel syndrome, diabetes, and alcoholism (Rolfes & Whitney 2013).
On the other extreme, in low protein diets, a niacin deficiency can result in pellagra otherwise known as primary pellagra. Secondary pellagra exists when there is sufficient niacin intake yet an obstacle such as liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, ulcerative colitis, or Hartnup disease prevents its proper absorption (Burton, Champion, Ebling, Rook, & Wilkinson, 1992). Rarely seen in industrialized nations, it remains primarily prevalent among developing countries. Originally, it was thought of as an infection and only through medical discovery was it realized that it actually resulted from diet inadequacies (Carpenter, 1985, J. Lewin, 1985). Symptoms include dermatitis resulting in thick, hard, scaly spots, itching and burning sensations, and sporadic lesions on the body. It can also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as diarrhea, poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting as well as dementia which results in fatigue, delusions, headaches, confusion, and disorientation (Burton, Champion, Ebling, Rook, & Wilkinson, 1992). If left untreated this disease can result in premature death.

8.3.1 Sources
[
]
Food sources of niacin include:
Milk
Eggs
Meat/Poultry
Fish
Whole-grain and enriched breads and cereals
Nuts
Lentils
Coffee
Instead of dietary niacin, the human body is also able to convert dietary tryptophan into niacin. In this case, 60 mg of tryptophan is equal to 1 mg of niacin (Meštrović, 2014).
In terms of supplements, niacin exists as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid. Reasons to take niacin supplements would be to better control cholesterol levels, as well as reduce cardiovascular risks.
8.3.2 Functions
[
]
Niacin functions as an intermediate for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and a phosphate form of NAD, NADP. These coenzymes are required by hundreds of enzymes in the body to move electrons and help undergo oxidation-reduction reactions. These redox reactions are involved in catabolizing glucose, fat, and alcohol to ultimately produce energy (Higdon, 2013). In general, B-vitamins help maintain a healthy liver, skin, hair, eyes, and a properly working nervous system. Also, niacin aids in increasing amounts of HDL (high-density lipoproteins), in the body; this augmentation helps in lowering levels of bad, LDL (low-density lipoproteins) in the bloodstream (Ehrlich, 2015). This is especially important in reducing risks of coronary heart disease.
8.3.3 Absorption and Transport
[
]
Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are absorbed rapidly from the intestines and stomach. Absorption is mediated by different processes depending on the concentration of niacin. When the concentration is high, absorption is mediated by passive diffusion. On the other hand, at lower concentrations absorption is mediated by facilitated diffusion that is dependent on sodium-ions (Institute of Medicine Standing Committee, 1998). Niacin doses ranging from 3 to 4 grams are almost fully absorbed. Enzymes in the intestines and liver catalyze NAD to release nicotinamide, and it is transported to the tissues where it is used to make NAD when necessary. Both forms of niacin use simple diffusion to enter cells, and both also use facilitated transport when entering erythrocytes (Institute of Medicine Standing Committee, 1998).
8.3.4 Requirements
[
]
Niacin (vitamin B₃) deficiency is generally uncommon in developed countries, but tends to reside in the homeless or impoverished populations. These populations tend to have poor diet and high alcohol consumption, which impact niacin absorption.
Many processed foods, such as bread and cereal, found in the United States are fortified with niacin as well as other B-vitamins to prevent dietary inadequacies. If niacin is not available, tryptophan can be synthesized in small amounts to produce niacin for the body.
Inadequate niacin and/or tryptophan dietary intake can create a dietary deficiency. General causes of inadequate levels of B₃ include diarrhea, alcoholism, obesity, eating disorders, and malnutrition. Niacin deficiency typically accompanies other B-vitamin deficiencies, such as B₆ or B₁₂. This makes it difficult to determine the exact cause of symptoms and thus makes it more difficult to treat. Inadequate intake of niacin is more common among those with corn-based diets. This is because the niacin present in corn is not available for humans to utilize unless it is alkalized first. People who live in Mexico generally do not have issues with niacin deficiency because corn tortillas, which are treated with alkali (soaked), are a dietary staple. Once the corn tortillas are treated with alkali, the niacin becomes biologically available to humans. Corn proteins are also very low in tryptophan thus increasing the risk of niacin deficiency.
The symptoms of B₃ deficiency range in severity, but generally impact the stomach and skin first. The disease associated with severe niacin deficiency is called Pellagra and is characterized by the three D’s: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Pellagra changes the texture and appearance of skin and causes lesions to develop. Skin may become cracked, scaly, and sometimes darkened if exposed to the sun. Skin conditions may or may not appear in conjunction with other symptoms, or even at all. The gastrointestinal tract can also be impacted by a lack of niacin.
Primarily, Pellagra causes stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Pain in the mouth can also result and may even lead to a swollen and reddened tongue. Low levels of B₃ can impact the nervous system if left untreated. Problems such as dizziness, headaches, anxiety, depression, and Dementia (which is mental degradation) can result. If these problems persist and are not supplemented with niacin and/or tryptophan, death could be the ultimate result.
Treatment of mild niacin deficiency usually just entails regular doses of niacin, within the RDA (see section 8.3.3). Severe deficiency, called Pellagra, is often treated with nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is used because it can be taken in higher doses without the risk of niacin toxicity (see section 8.3.5). Niacin deficiencies are usually treating with a multi-complex B-vitamin. This is done to help treat deficiencies in all of the B-vitamins, which commonly accompany B₃ deficiency.
8.3.5 Toxicity
[
]
The intake of too much niacin could result in a niacin flush, which leads to the dilation of the capillaries and could be painful. Symptoms may include: painful flush and rash, itching, nausea, excessive sweating, blurred vision, liver damage, and impaired glucose tolerance. If taken in large doses, hepatotoxicity may occur, which is where liver cells are damaged. Jaundice has also been known to be a result in too much niacin. Dry skin, skin rashes, low blood pressure, and headaches are also common occurrences when niacin is taken in large amounts. Other than hepatotoxicity, extremely large amounts of niacin in the body can cause gout, an irregular heartbeat, and ulcers in the digestive tract (Higdon, 2013). Also, a study found that those who consume high levels of niacin are twice as susceptible to a stroke. With all these side effects and risks, the upper level of 35 mg of niacin each day is recommended; not surpassing this amount is likely to result in no health risks.
8.3.6 Bioavailability
[
]
Niacin is only about 30% available in developed cereal grains because it is largely bound, but with alkali treatment the absorption percentage is increased (Institute of Medicine Standing Committee, 1998). In meats, niacin appears in its NAD/NADP form and is notably more abundant. Also, in the cases where niacin is added to foods during fortification or enrichment, it is done so in its free form and so is greatly available. Food sources like liver and beans contain niacin in its free form. Below the bioavailability of niacin in its nicotinic acid and nicotinamide forms is discussed.
Nicotinic Acid:
The Council for Responsible Nutrition (2013) noted that the uptake of nicotinic acid in the intestines was rapid and almost total. After being absorbed, 15-30 % of the plasma nicotinic acid is bound to protein. When the intake is at lower levels nutritional functions related to coenzymes containing NM occur; whereas at higher levels of intake (> 50 mg/day) a flushing effect with undesirable vasodilation can occur (MacKay, Hathcock, & Guarneri, 2012). At much higher levels of intake (500 – 3000 mga/day) serum lipid profiles report beneficial outcomes (CRN, 2013).
Nicotinamide :
Nicotinamide is abundantly bioavailable and is capable of defending against pellagra, which is one of the definitive signs of a niacin deficiency. The beneficial changes with plasma lipids or flushing effect are not seen with nicotinamide as it is not converted to nicotinic acid sufficiently. In a certain study female students in college were given 51 mg of NM and in the end it was found that nearly half was excreted as metabolites in urine (MacKay et al., 2012). In CRN (2013) it was noted that intensifying doses (3g – 10g) of NM presented a linear correlation between the dose amount and the maximum recorded concentration of plasma.
Further Information:
The bioavailability of Niacin differs among the several forms it can take. These forms are nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and any other derivatives that can be converted into nicotinic acid once absorbed in the body. There are some that may argue that the derivatives might not technically be considered niacin, however it really depends on the biological effects the derivatives have after absorption. If the derivatives, such as inositol hexanicotinate, uptake has a similar chemical reaction and affects the metabolism of the organism similar to that of the primary form of niacin, it can be used as evidence to properly identify it as niacin.
When niacin is absorbed as nicotinic acid, it is typically transported through the intestines. Nicotinic acid is absorbed through the intestinal lining and it is described as rapid and nearly total. For example, if there is a large dose of 3 – 4 grams of nicotinic acid, it will be almost completely absorbed by an average, adult body and 30% of the plasma nicotinic acid is bounded to plasma protein (Institute of Medicine, 1998). There is usually a “flushing effect” that occurs when consumption exceeds 50 mg per day.
To avoid the flushing effect, there is now investigations regarding an extended release nicotinic acid that slowly releases nicotinic acid. It is being researched to see if its benefits and efficiency outweigh free flowing nicotinic acid. Extended released forms are being produced using ion exchange methods and using wax materials that melt slowly with body temperature. The extended release time depends on the delivery matrix, and it has been seen thus far that absorption of nicotinic acid is much slower than it free flowing counterpart, however it is still achieve effective levels needed.
The bioavailability of nicotinamide is a little different from nicotinic acid. In 1995, Kim Dragovic conducted an experiment with seven healthy individuals, giving them different doses of nicotinamide that was taken orally. It took about 30 minutes for maximum plasma levels to be reached, seen in most patients after taking 6 grams of nicotinamide. The other dosage levels that patients all could tolerate well were 3, 4, 5, and 6 grams. The final dosage level tested was 10 grams, which was not tolerated as well, however maximum plasma levels were achieved for at least 4 hours straight (Dragovic 1995).
Niacin is best absorbed through food sources such as yeast, meat, poultry, and red fish. It has been seen though that in mature cereal grains, niacin binds to the sugar glucose molecules, therefore decreasing niacin bioavailability.
Niacin in ordinary cereal grains has a relatively low 30% bioavailability that gets absorbed into the body. Bioavailability factors with niacin often affect the metabolism of tryptophan commonly seen in individuals with pellagra. Niacin however has a higher bioavailability in milk, meat, beans, and eggs. Some niacin containing foods, such as corn, contain Vitamin B3 chemically bound to it thus inhibiting its absorption and metabolism throughout digestion. Foods with high concentrations of leucine are also known to disrupt the metabolism of tryptophan followed by the metabolic inhibition of niacin thereafter.1 Niacin can be found in many forms like nicotinic acid that has a very rapid and almost stoichiometric intestinal uptake. Bolus doses of 3-4g nicotinic acid are almost completely absorbed by adults. After absorption in the intestine 15-30% of the nicotinic acid is bounded to proteins. Nicotinamide another form of Niacin, has coenzymes that function at lower levels of niacin intake, around 15–18 mg/day. (Mackay, 2012) At higher levels, over 50 mg/day, niacin intake can have a vasodilative flushing effect. An extended release form of nicotinic acid has been developed as a result of the flushing. The extended release form of nicotinic acid has been under research to explore their potential benefits on serum lipids that usually occurs at much higher levels of intake around 500-3,000 mg/day. Nicotinamide and its coenzymes don’t require much intake because it is readily bioavailable making it also an effective treatment for preventing pellagra. Female college students were administered 51 mg of nicotinamide, of which 52% was excreted as urinary metabolites. Nicotinamide is not sufficiently converted to NA to produce either the undesirable flushing effect or the beneficial changes in plasma lipids. Another form of niacin called inositol hexanicotinate. This chemical compound consists of six nicotinic acid molecules all bonded to an inositol molecule at the center of the structure. Often referred to as “No-Flush Niacin” inositol hexanicotinate also inhibits the flushing affect that most people find unacceptable.2 Inositol hexanicotinate is hydrolyzed at a slow rate throughout the body freeing up the nicotinic acid molecules and the inositol. Its unique properties allow it to be metabolized providing true niacin activity but without the flushing individuals may experience. However there are still a lot of grey areas to be clarified regarding inositol hexanicotinate. Being one of the forms of niacin with the least adverse affects there is still very little data on how well inositol hexanicotinate benefits serum lipids. There is a debate on whether the chemistry behind inositol hexanicotinate is really interchangeable or not. Recent studies on the effects of inositol hexanicotinate on blood lipids have been depicting bioavailability levels for nicotinic acid to be too low to be even considered a form of niacin.

Folate
Vitamin B12
8.4 Folate
[
]
Folate is a water-soluble B Vitamin. Originally called folacin1, the term folate is used for its natural occurring forms and is also known as pteroylglutamic acid.
Folate’s natural form contains a p-aminobenzoic head, a pteridine ring, and a polyglutamate tail which is how the body receives it, this also known as its ‘bound’ form. The enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase(GCPII), located within enterocytes, cleaves terminal glutamates and leaves an absorbable, monoglutamated folate. The vitamin is then reduced from dyhydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DFR) and delivered to the liver and other cells within the body. Folate can be methylated into 5-methylTHF prior to its release from the intestines, or within the liver.The methylated form of folate is inactive and can only be activated by removing the methyl group using an enzyme and the vitamin B
12
.
In the United States, Folic Acid is one of the five fortified vitamins and minerals in grain. This fact alone demonstrates the pivotal part that folate plays in the human body. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began to mandate that manufacturers fortify folic acid in flours, pastas, breads, and rice in 1998 (National Institutes of Health, 2012). The four other vitamins are minerals are Thiamin, Niacin, Riboflavin, and Iron, which are also crucial nutrients for the performance and structure of the body.
It is important to note that the Folic Acid we supplement in our diet is different from the Folate we find in nature. In nature, Folate is bound up into polyglutamates. Similar to monosaccharaides making up polysaccharides, a polyglutamate is simply many glutamates linked together. Folic acid is a singular glutamate. The reason the FDA required enrichment of Folic Acid rather than Folate is that the polyglutamate is already broken up into singular glutamates and therefore the digestive system does not have to do as much work. Folic acid is found in supplements and in enriched products. Folate is found in dark green vegetables, legumes, and some citrus products (Medline Plus, 2015). Specifically, some foods that are very high in their percent of dietary folate are beef liver, spinach, and black-eyed peas (National Institutes of Health, 2012).
The synthetic form of folate is referred to as folic acid, a monoglutamate, which is found in supplements and fortified foods. Folate is primarily used in the coenzyme THF (tetrahydrofolate) that transfers 1-carbon compounds in metabolism.
8.4.1 Sources
[
]
Folate cannot be synthesized by the body, so we must consume it to get an adequate intake. From the diet, folate is found in high quantities in legumes, fruits and vegetables. Of these, lentils and asparagus have an exceptional amount of folate.
Food folate varies in bioavailability and digestability. While the body is able to absorb at least 85% of synthetic folate supplements (folic acid) or folic acid from fortification, no more than 50% of folate naturally present in food is absorbed, relative to the absorption of folic acid.  The analysis by McNulty and Pentieva lists factors affecting the bioavailability of folate to include polyglutamate folates, the food matrix, instability of labile folates during digestion, and the presence of folate binding proteins present in the diet. The same group also reported a lack of understanding in folate availability and folate absorption mechanisms, and concluded more information is needed on the topic.
Folate is critical for pregnant women because of its effects on growing infants and its ability to prevent major birth defects. Because of this the government has mandated that food be fortified with folic acid. The majority of these enriched foods are grains such as bread, pasta, rice and cereal.
Being the monoglutamate form, folic acid is a lot easier to absorb into the body then folate. This is why supplements are actually encouraged for folic acid, especially for pregnant women.
8.4.2 Metabolism and Functions
[
]
Folate is required for amino acid synthesis, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and formation of S-adenosylmethionine4. Consequently, folate affects DNA synthesis and methylation, folate lowers homocysteine levels and raises levels of methionine and glutathione. In the form of 5-methylTHF, folate acts as a coenzyme that can accept and donate one-carbon units.
As a part of THF, folate accepts and donates 1-carbon groups for the synthesis of thymidine and purines as well as being involved in the regeneration of homocysteine to methionine, with the assistance of Vitamin B12.
It is thus important for cell maintenance, DNA and RNA synthesis, and maturation of red blood cells. This is what makes it so critical for pregnant women and infants.
The figure depicts the folate cycle. Folate enters the cycle as polyglutamyl THF and is converted into 5,10-methyleneTHF using serine as the primary carbon source. This reaction requires the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and PLP, the coenzyme derived from vitamin B62. 5,10-methylene can participate in both nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions. 5,10-methyleneTHF can react with deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to form thymidylate (dTMP), the precursor to the pyrimidine nucleobase thymine1. This is a rate-limiting step in the procession of DNA replication. In a folate deficiency, thymine cannot be formed and DNA synthesis and cell division is severely impaired. Once a methyl group is transferred from 5,10-methyleneTHF to dUMP, the folate is left in its oxidized state, dihydrofolate (DHF). This can be reduced and recycled into the folate cycle as THF. 5,10-methyleneTHF can be transformed (by an unknown mechanism) into 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. 10-formylTHF is used in the synthesis of the purine nucleobases adenine and guanine. THF is released as a product of the reaction, and recycled. 5,10-methyleneTHF can also be reduced, by the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)6 to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This is an irreversible reaction, so folate cannot be reverted directly back to its 5,10mTHF state. With the help of cobalamin, derived from vitamin B12, 5-methylTHF can be used in DNA methylation.
1-carbon metabolism
Methionine synthase (MS) is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. 5-methylTHF works as the substrate for methyl transference with MS. MS takes the methyl group from 5-methylTHF and transfers it to cobalamin forming methylcobalamin. This goes on to move the same methyl group to homocysteine, releasing methionine. This process regenerates THF, allowing folate to continue to work in the body.  Methionine is vital to the formation of S-adenosyl methionine(SAM)1, an important agent in other methyltransferase reactions. SAM is required for DNA methylation, neurotransmitter synthesis, and phospholipid synthesis. Once the methyl group from SAM has been transferred, S-adenosyl homocysteine is left, which loses its adenosine to reform homocysteine, requiring more folate, in the form of 5-methylTHF, to continue acting in the body.
8.4.3 Requirements
[
]
Folate is absorbed about 50% from foods eaten and 100% from supplements.
The RDA for folate is 400 μg/day DFE for ages 14 and up.
Children need roughly 200 μg/day of DFE (dietary folate equivalent). However, since it is so critical for pregnant and nursing women, their RDA is 600 μg/day DFE. The upper limit of folate is 1000 μg/day for adults.
Folate is heavily involved with the Vitamin B12. Both are activated by the other and both are involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This is why the healthy function of folate cannot occur without adequate B
12
supply.
One of the most important steps a woman can take to protect her growing baby before it is born is to consume plenty of folic acid every day.  Folate is a B vitamin that is essential to good health.  Its natural form is called folate, and it occurs naturally in certain foods.  The synthetic form of this vitamin is called folic acid, and it is added in fortified foods and vitamin pills.  In the United States, all foods made from grains are fortified with folic acid.
The Dietary Reference Intakes provide recommendations for folate intake.
For adults, the recommended amount of folic acid is 400 mcg a day, but intake recommendations vary under different conditions. For example, women who are able to get pregnant need higher amounts of folate because of the huge role folic acid plays in preventing birth defects.
Even during post pregnancy, if breast-feeding, folate will make sure the infant gets the nutrition he or she needs to be healthy.
While it is true that the majority of the population can get the recommended amount of folate by eating a well-rounded diet, it may not be enough to prevent birth defects in a pregnant woman.
This is because naturally occurring folate is not absorbed as easily as folic acid. Folic acid has a higher bioavailability at 85% whereas the naturally present folate has only a 50% bioavailability.
To compensate for this difference in bioavailability and intake needs for men and women and age groups, the following two graphs illustrate both the average recommended folic acid for various age groups (Table 1), and the higher amount of folic acid women should consume if they are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age (Table 2).

Folate is seen as very important for women of child bearing age, especially those who are pregnant. If a pregnant woman does not meet her folate requirements, it is highly likely her child will be born with a neural tube defect, which is when the brain and spinal cord are not developed properly—leading to disability or even death to the infant.
Often, in the past folate has only been seen as a necessary nutrient to prevent megaloblastic anemia. The importance of folate has been underestimated so much that in 1989, the Food and Nutrition Board reduced the recommended dietary allowance simply because the incidence rate of anemia was low (American Heart Association, 2002). However as the field of nutritional science grows, it is evident that folate is necessary for preventing Neural Tube defects in pregnancy and reducing the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
During DNA synthesis, vitamin B12 and folic acid work together. When folic acid is stored, a methyl group (CH4) is added. Folic acid remains in cells in this inactive form until it is activated. Folic Acid is activated by the vitamin B12. The amino acid, homocysteine, which is attached to the B12 removes the methyl group from the folic acid. This methyl transfer to homocysteine generates methionine, which then sets off a series of reactions. Without folic acid, homocysteine will not be used in the body and can accumulate. Accumulated homocysteine is very dangerous. High levels of homocysteine lead to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the enlargement of artery walls caused by lipid stores and muscle cell proliferation (The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2000). The amino acid homocysteine contributes to the thrombogenicity of blood, or the ability for blood to clot. Simply, homocysteine in a way makes blood thicker and more clot-like. Thrombogenic blood is more likely to clog in arteries and cause atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis then leads to blocked arteries and can cause heart attacks and strokes. To summarize, accumulated homocysteine increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and proves the necessity for adequate folic acid intake. In conclusion, it is critical to understand the importance of folate in the diet. Whether acquired from enriched products, supplementation, or naturally in foods, folate is vital for healthy body function.
Folate deficiency also leads to a decrease in red blood cell and GI tract cell production. Because of this, the onset of a folate deficiency is characterized by anemia and GI tract deterioration. The anemia of a folate deficiency is called macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia. Folate’s presence is required for DNA to properly replicate red blood cells, so a lack of folate leads to a damaged DNA and immature red blood cells. The end result is very large red blood cells that cannot carry oxygen properly, travel through the bloodstream inefficiently and occasionally have nuclei.
Folate is implicated in many anticancer treatments, so it is very easy to develop a secondary folate deficiency. If a person is taking drugs with anticancer properties, many of them have similar structures to folate and they overtake folate and impede normal metabolism. Moreover, anticancer drugs affect both healthy and unhealthy cells, leading to a folate deficiency throughout the body.
8.4.5 Toxicity
[
]
Research hasn’t found much diseases from ingesting too much folate. However, there is an upper limit set because folate can mask a B
12
deficiency. A B
12
deficiency leads to nerve damage which in turn leads to irreversible damage to the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, there are tentative claims that folate can lead to various forms of cancer.

Vitamin B12
Vitamin B6
8.5 Vitamin B12
[
]
Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin also known as Cobalamin. Water soluble vitamins are hydrophilic and are absorbed directly into the blood where they travel freely in water filled compartments through out the body. The water soluble vitamins are less likely to create toxicity in the body due to the daily excretion of excess vitamins in urine. B12 helps with the synthesis of new cells, is a coenzyme to folate, and helps to break down fatty acids and amino acids in the daily diet (Whitney, 2002).
8.5.1 Sources
[
]
Vitamin B12 is only found it animal products including: meat, fish, poultry, milk cheese and eggs. Since B12 is not naturally occurring in grains, it can be fortified into different cereals and breads (Whitney, 2002).
The vitamin is also produced in the colon of humans by bacteria, but not enough is absorbed to be considered a good source. In ruminants B12 is synthesized using bacteria and cobalt, it is carried to the blood and enterocytes on the carrier Transcobalamin (Albert, 1980).
The greatest source of vitamin B12 is milk and fish.  It is primarily found in animal products (Whitney, 2002).  The reason that vegans have difficult consuming enough vitamin B12 is that finding sources that are not animal products is difficult.  A couple of options include fortified soymilk or vitamin B12 supplements (Whitney, 2002).
The bioavailability of vitamin B12 in humans from fish meat averages 42 percent, sheep meat 56-89 percent, and chicken 61-66 percent (Watanabe, 2007).  Compared to other animal products, B12 in eggs is not as well absorbed.  Absorption is less than nine percent while typically 50 percent of B12 consumed will be absorbed (Watanabe, 2007).
While vitamin B12 is often reported as a nutrient in plants, the amounts could be inaccurate because the vitamin is in a form that cannot be absorbed and used by the body (Roman, 2013).
8.5.2 Functions
[
]
B12 creates the coenzyme to help activate folate, and helps to maintain nerve cells by protecting and synthesis of the myelin sheath. Another important function is the synthesis of new cells, specifically red blood cells with the production of hemoglobin and the synthesis of the coenzyme methylcobalamin. Some methylcobalamin is converted into homocysteine, which can result in cardiovascular disease at high concentrations (“Coenzyme Functions”).
Vitamin B12 is required for healthy neurological development, biological methylation and DNA synthesis.  Another function it participates in is the mitochondrial catabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and some amino acids (Troen).  Limited evidence has also been found suggesting there is an association between vitamin B12 and neurological function in older adults (Miles, 2015).  There is still little research as to what roles vitamin B12 plays in memory, but as more information is discovered, more correlations between memory and B12 are found.
Another function vitamin B12 plays is in maternal development.  Vitamin B12 is involved in one-carbon metabolism along with folate and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and plays a major role during pregnancy in developing the fetus and is an important determinant of epigenesist (Dhobale, 2012).  Low-weight babies have a higher risk for developing brain disorders such as cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders because of this (Dhobale, 2012).
Vitamin B12 depends on folate for activation and folate depends on vitamin B12.  Vitamin B12 removes a methyl group to active folate which in tern activates vitamin B12 when folate gives up the methyl group (Whitney, 2002k).   The regeneration of methionine and the synthesis of DNA and RNA need both folate and vitamin B12 (Whitney, 2002).
8.5.3 Requirements
[
]
Vitamin B-12 requirements vary by age. Recommended daily amounts (RDAs) are shown below (National Institutes of Health). According to two cross-sectional studies done comparing men to women, B-12 requirements do not very by gender (Rosner and Schreiber, 1972; Scott et al., 1974). Vitamin B-12 requirements do, however, increase for pregnant and lactating women because the mother transfers some to the infant via the placenta and through breast milk (Kaiser, 2008). No UL has been set for vitamin B-12 (Whitney and Rolfes, 2014).
Caption
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) set in 1998 for adults is 2.4 µg/day.
People over the age of 50 need higher amounts due to a decrease in absorption (Whitney, 2002).
8.5.4 Deficiency
[
]
People who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet have a higher chance of developing a deficiency (Pawlak, 2013, 110). To avoid such deficiencies having an adequate intake of animal products such as eggs and milk for vegetarians or consuming foods that are enriched with B12 for individuals who follow a vegan diet. Supplements can also be taken to decrease the likelihood of a deficiency.
Megaloblastic Anemia (large cell type) is due to a deficiency in B12 or folate; a high folate level can mask the deficiency of B12 and correct the anima, but not the damage to the heme (“Vitamin B12 Deficiency And Paralysis”).
Pernicious Anemia is caused by the lack of red blood cells due to a deficiency in B12, caused primarily by a lack of intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is the protein secreted by the stomach to help the intestines absorb vitamin B12. A lack in intrinsic factor can be a result of old age or Atrophic Gastritis which is the inflammation of the stomach epithelium which results in loss of the stomach mucosa cells which secrete the intrinsic factor and other digestive enzymes (Zayouna).
Muscle Weakness and Paralysis- B12 deficiency can result in skeletal muscle weakness due to decreased nerve cell function, in more serious cases where the B12 stores are completely depleted paralysis can occur (Morris, 2012, p. 1457).
Memory Loss- With a deficiency fewer red blood cells are synthesized resulting in anemia, with less than usual red blood cell count a decreased amount of essential nutrients are delivered to the brain. Some people with a severe deficiency could be misdiagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease due to the similar symptoms (“Vitamin B12 Deficiency And Paralysis”).
Other deficiency symptoms include fatigue and dizziness, which are side effects of anemia
Vitamin B-12 deficiency can lead to decreased neurological function, prevent DNA and RNA synthesis, impair liver and pancreatic function, and damage the intestinal tract including loss of villi and decreased nutrient absorption (Riordan, 2012). It is important in the production of red blood cells, and can help to prevent or correct pernicious anemia (Frazier).
Because vitamin B-12 is only found in meat products, most deficiency occurs in vegans, infants breast fed by vegans, and the elderly. Vegans do not consume any animal products. This means that they need another reliable source of the vitamin, usually in the form of an oral supplement or a fortified plant-based milk. Infants breast fed by vegans can develop deficiency only a few months following birth (National Institutes of Health). To prevent this, B-12 should be supplemented during both pregnancy and lactation to transfer enough to the fetus and infant to avoid developmental delays (Kaiser, 2008).
Elderly are at risk of becoming B-12 deficient because as they age their stomach produces decreased amounts of HCl which is necessary to break down protein efficiently enough to unbind B-12. This phenomenon, called atrophic gastritis, is characterized by thinned stomach lining resulting in insufficient vitamin absorption regardless of availability (Dunkin, 2013). For this reason, a vitamin B-12 supplement is recommended in older adults (Von Castel-Roberts, 2015).
Those suffering from dietary vitamin B-12 deficiency can recover by adding B-12 into their diets either through meat, fortified foods, or a supplement (Dunkin, 2013). However, prolonged deficiency may lead to irreversible damage.
Pernicious anemia is decreased red blood cell production by lack of vitamin B-12. An intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach that binds with B-12, is necessary for intestinal absorption. Those who lack the intrinsic factor necessary to absorb B-12 (by either a genetic defect or an injured stomach) will develop pernicious anemia, as they are not able to absorb B-12 in the small intestine no matter how much of the vitamin they get from food (Institute of Medicine, 1998). Individuals lacking the intrinsic factor require medical treatment. Data from over one hundred patients with pernicious anemia revealed that liver and stomach therapy increased red blood cell production (Raphael, 1938). Also, a B-12 injection would provide enough of the vitamin while bypassing intestinal absorption (Whitney and Rolfes, 2014).
8.5.5 Toxicity
[
]
There is no reported vitamin B-12 toxicity to date. Being a water-soluble vitamin, B-12 is difficult to overdose or build up in toxic amounts since the body excretes excess amounts in the urine instead of storing it (Frazier). Many B-12 vitamins are combined with other B vitamins, including riboflavin.  If you have ever noticed that your urine is bright yellow after taking a B-complex vitamin, it is the result of extra riboflavin being excreted in the urine.
8.5.6 Absorption
[
]
The absorption of vitamin B12 in the body is a multistep process that requires many other compounds before entering the bloodstream. Absorption of B12 is essential for it to be able to perform its vital functions in the body.
If it is consumed in animal products, the vitamin is attached to proteins (“Vitamin B12”). When this complex enters the stomach, chief cells and parietal cells from pits in the lining of the stomach secrete pepsin and hydrochloric acid, respectively.  These compounds break vitamin B12 off from the proteins (Marieb, 2011). Also in the stomach, B12 binds to an R-protein that comes from the salivary glands.  This complex enters the small intestine where B12 separates from the protein by pancreatic enzymes. Vitamin B12 then binds with intrinsic factor, which is synthesized in the stomach, and travels to the last section of the small intestine, the ileum. Here, the intrinsic factor binds to a receptor site at the lining of the small intestine so vitamin B12 can be absorbed by crossing the intestinal cell membrane.  Vitamin B12 then attached to a protein called transcobalamin II so it can enter the bloodstream via the portal vein. Once Vitamin B12 enters the bloodstream it gets to the bone marrow and red blood cells which allows for it to carry out its main functions in maintaining healthy red blood cells, maintaining healthy nervous tissue, and being utilized in DNA synthesis. Since there are so many steps and other compounds in these absorption processes, not having one of the proteins or enough intrinsic factor could actually lead to a B12 deficiency independent of how much the vitamin is consumed in the diet (Whitney, 2002).
8.5.7 Role in DNA Synthesis
[
]
Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the synthesis of DNA.  It is a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase.  This enzyme catalyzes the reaction that converts homocysteine to the methionine protein. S-adenosylmethionine, made from methionine, donates a methyl for DNA (“Vitamin B12”).
8.5.8 B12 and Folate
[
]
As with all B vitamins, vitamin B12 plays an active role in human metabolism (Ehrlich). B12 converts THF, a form of folate, to its active form by removing a methyl group.  This process allows folate to enter the TCA cycle.  Thus, B12 is used in the formation of new cells (“Vitamin B12”).

Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that was first isolated in the 1930s. There are three traditionally considered forms of vitamin B6: pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM). The phosphate ester derivative pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the principal coenzyme form and has the most importance in human metabolism (1-3).
Vitamin B6 must be obtained from the diet because humans cannot synthesize it. PLP plays a vital role in the function of approximately 100 enzymes that catalyze essential chemical reactions in the human body (1-5). For example, PLP functions as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the release of glucose from stored glycogen. Much of the PLP in the human body is found in muscle bound to glycogen phosphorylase. PLP is also a coenzyme for reactions used to generate glucose from amino acids, a process known as gluconeogenesis (4, 5).
Vitamin B6 can be found in various type of foods (Vanderschuren et. al., 2013).  It can be found in high quantities in meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products (Vanderschuren et. al., 2013; Ross et. al., 2014). It can also be found in some vegetables, non-citrus fruits, grain cereals and nuts (Ross et. al., 2014; Jain et. al., 2002).
Since vitamin B6 can be lost during processing and storage, it is found fortified in some products such as cereals (Ross et. al., 2014; Gregory, 2006). Vitamin B6 is also available in dietary supplements, such as multivitamins and b-complex or as an isolated supplement. Normally, the supplemented form is found as pyridoxine, from which absorption is comparable with the forms obtained from food sources (Ross et. al., 2014).
Bioavailability:
It is estimated that in an assorted diet about 75% of B6 is bioavailable (Tarr et. al., 1981). However, bioavailability can be affected by food handling and the stability of the vitamin during storage. The stability of B6 in its natural form can be affected by temperature, canning, humidity and time of storage. Contrastingly, the fortified form pyridoxine hydrochloride has been found to be more stable to those changes, with an approximate retention of 90 to 100% (Gregory, 2006).
Nutrient interactions:
Metabolism of vitamin B6 is affected by the interaction with other nutrients.  During the metabolic process, niacin and riboflavin coenzymes are necessary for aldehyde dehydrogenase. Furthermore, zinc will be required as a cofactor for phosphorylation of B6 (Ross et. al., 2014).
8.6.2 Functions
[
]
Nervous system function
In the brain, the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, serotonin, from the amino acid, tryptophan, is catalyzed by a PLP-dependent enzyme. Other neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are also synthesized using PLP-dependent enzymes (4).
Red blood cell formation and function
PLP functions as a coenzyme in the synthesis of heme, an iron-containing component of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells and is critical to their ability to transport oxygen throughout the body. Both PL and PLP are able to bind to the hemoglobin molecule and affect its ability to pick up and release oxygen. However, the impact of this on normal oxygen delivery to tissues is not known (4).
Niacin formation
The human requirement for another B vitamin, niacin, can be met in part by the conversion of the essential amino acid, tryptophan, to niacin, as well as through dietary intake. PLP is a coenzyme for a critical reaction in the synthesis of niacin from tryptophan; thus, adequate vitamin B6 decreases the requirement for dietary niacin (4).
Hormone function
Steroid hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, exert their effects in the body by binding to steroid hormone receptors in the nucleus of the cell and altering gene transcription. PLP binds to steroid receptors in a manner that inhibits the binding of steroid hormones, thus decreasing their effects. The binding of PLP to steroid receptors for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and other steroid hormones suggests that the vitamin B6 status of an individual may have implications for diseases affected by steroid hormones, including breast cancer and prostate cancers (4).
Nucleic acid synthesis
PLP serves as a coenzyme for a key enzyme involved in the mobilization of single-carbon functional groups (one-carbon metabolism). Such reactions are involved in the synthesis of nucleic acids. The effect of vitamin B6 deficiency on the function of the immune system may be partly related to the role of PLP in one-carbon metabolism (see Disease Prevention).
Homocysteine and cardiovascular disease
Even moderately elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke (8). During protein digestion, amino acids, including methionine, are released. Homocysteine is an intermediate in the metabolism of methionine. Healthy individuals utilize two different pathways to metabolize homocysteine. One pathway converts homocysteine back to methionine and is dependent on folic acid and vitamin B12. The other pathway converts homocysteine to the amino acid cysteine and requires two vitamin B6(PLP)-dependent enzymes. Thus, the amount of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by at least three vitamins: folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 (diagram). Several large observational studies have demonstrated an association between low vitamin B6 intake or status with increased blood homocysteine levels and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. A large prospective study found the risk of heart disease in women who consumed, on average, 4.6 mg of vitamin B6 daily was only 67% of the risk in women who consumed an average of 1.1 mg daily (9). Another large prospective study found higher plasma levels of PLP were associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease independent of homocysteine levels (10). Further, several studies have reported that low plasma PLP status is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (11-13). In contrast to folic acid supplementation, studies supplementing individuals with only vitamin B6 have not resulted in significant decreases in basal (fasting) levels of homocysteine. However, one study found that vitamin B6 supplementation was effective in lowering blood homocysteine levels after an oral dose of methionine (methionine load test) was given (14), suggesting vitamin B6 may play a role in the metabolism of homocysteine after meals.
Immune function
Low vitamin B6 intake and nutritional status have been associated with impaired immune function, especially in the elderly. Decreased production of immune system cells known as lymphocytes, as well as decreased production of an important immune system protein called interleukin-2, have been reported in vitamin B6 deficient individuals (15). Restoration of vitamin B6 status has resulted in normalization of lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production, suggesting that adequate vitamin B6 intake is important for optimal immune system function in older individuals (15, 16). However, one study found that the amount of vitamin B6 required to reverse these immune system impairments in the elderly was 2.9 mg/day for men and 1.9 mg/day for women; these vitamin B6 requirements are higher than the current RDA (15).
Cognitive function
A few studies have associated cognitive decline in the elderly or Alzheimer's disease with inadequate nutritional status of folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 and thus, elevated levels of homocysteine (17). One observational study found that higher plasma vitamin B6 levels were associated with better performance on two measures of memory, but plasma vitamin B6 levels were unrelated to performance on 18 other cognitive tests (18). Similarly, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 38 healthy elderly men found that vitamin B6 supplementation improved memory but had no effect on mood or mental performance (19). Further, a placebo-controlled trial in 211 healthy younger, middle-aged, and older women found that vitamin B6 supplementation (75 mg/day) for five weeks improved memory performance in some age groups but had no effect on mood (20). Recently, a systematic review of randomized trials concluded that there is inadequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or folic acid improves cognition in those with normal or impaired cognitive function (21). Because of mixed findings, it is presently unclear whether supplementation with B vitamins might blunt cognitive decline in the elderly. Further, it is not known if marginal B vitamin deficiencies, which are relatively common in the elderly, even contribute to age-associated declines in cognitive function, or whether both result from processes associated with aging and/or disease.
Kidney stones
A large prospective study examined the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of symptomatic kidney stones in women. A group of more than 85,000 women without a prior history of kidney stones were followed over 14 years and those who consumed 40 mg or more of vitamin B6 daily had only two thirds the risk of developing kidney stones compared with those who consumed 3 mg or less (22). However, in a group of more than 45,000 men followed over six years, no association was found between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of kidney stones (23). Limited data have shown that supplementation of vitamin B6 at levels higher than the tolerable upper intake level (100 mg/day) decreases elevated urinary oxalate levels, an important determinant of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation in some individuals. However, it is less clear that supplementation actually resulted in decreased formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Presently, the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the risk of developing kidney stones requires further study before any recommendations can be made.
Disease Treatment
Vitamin B6 supplements at pharmacologic doses (i.e., doses much larger than those needed to prevent deficiency) have been used in an attempt to treat a wide variety of conditions, some of which are discussed below. In general, well designed, placebo-controlled studies have shown little evidence that large supplemental doses of vitamin B6 are beneficial (24).
Side effects of oral contraceptives
Because vitamin B6 is required for the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan, the tryptophan load test (an assay of tryptophan metabolites after an oral dose of tryptophan) was used as a functional assessment of vitamin B6 status. Abnormal tryptophan load tests in women taking high-dose oral contraceptives in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that these women were vitamin B6 deficient. Abnormal results in the tryptophan load test led a number of clinicians to prescribe high doses (100–150 mg/day) of vitamin B6 to women in order to relieve depression and other side effects sometimes experienced with oral contraceptives. However, most other indices of vitamin B6 status were normal in women on high-dose oral contraceptives, and it is unlikely that the abnormality in tryptophan metabolism was due to vitamin B6 deficiency (24). A more recent placebo-controlled study in women on the lower dose oral contraceptives, which are commonly prescribed today, found that doses up to 150 mg/day of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) had no benefit in preventing side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, depression, and irritability (25).
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
The use of vitamin B6 to relieve the side effects of high-dose oral contraceptives led to the use of vitamin B6 in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS refers to a cluster of symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, irritability, moodiness/depression, fluid retention, and breast tenderness, that begin sometime after ovulation (mid-cycle) and subside with the onset of menstruation (the monthly period). A review of 12 placebo-controlled double-blind trials on vitamin B6 use for PMS treatment concluded that evidence for a beneficial effect was weak (26). A more recent review of 25 studies suggested that supplemental vitamin B6, up to 100 mg/day, may be of value to treat PMS; however, only limited conclusions could be drawn because most of the studies were of poor quality (27).
Depression
Because a key enzyme in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine is PLP-dependent, it has been suggested that vitamin B6 deficiency may lead to depression.  However, clinical trials have not provided convincing evidence that vitamin B6 supplementation is an effective treatment for depression (24, 28), though vitamin B6 may have therapeutic efficacy in premenopausal women (28).
Morning sickness (nausea and vomiting in pregnancy)
Vitamin B6 has been used since the 1940s to treat nausea during pregnancy. Vitamin B6 was included in the medication Bendectin, which was prescribed for the treatment of morning sickness and later withdrawn from the market due to unproven concerns that it increased the risk of birth defects. Vitamin B6 itself is considered safe during pregnancy and has been used in pregnant women without any evidence of fetal harm (29). The results of two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that used 25 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for three days (30) or 10 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for five days (29) suggest that vitamin B6 may be beneficial in alleviating morning sickness. Each study found a slight but significant reduction in nausea or vomiting in pregnant women. A recent systematic review of placebo-controlled trials on nausea during early pregnancy found vitamin B6 to be somewhat effective (31). However, it should be noted that morning sickness also resolves without any treatment, making it difficult to perform well-controlled trials.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome causes numbness, pain, and weakness of the hand and fingers due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist. It may result from repetitive stress injury of the wrist or from soft tissue swelling, which sometimes occurs with pregnancy or hypothyroidism. Several early studies by the same investigator suggested that vitamin B6 status was low in individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome and that supplementation with 100–200 mg/day over several months was beneficial (32, 33). A recent study in men not taking vitamin supplements found that decreased blood levels of PLP were associated with increased pain, tingling, and nocturnal wakening, all symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (34). Studies using electrophysiological measurements of median nerve conduction have largely failed to find an association between vitamin B6 deficiency and carpal tunnel syndrome. While a few trials have noted some symptomatic relief with vitamin B6 supplementation, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have not generally found vitamin B6 to be effective in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (24, 35).
Glucose metabolism:
PLP coenzymes assist the enzymatic cleavage of glycogen during glucose synthesis. PLP is also necessary for acid catalysis in glycogenesis (Ross et. al., 2014).
Lipid Metabolism:
PLP plays an important role in the biosynthetic pathway of carnitine. This process is important for transporting long chain fatty acids (Ross et. al., 2014). Also, it is important in protecting the cell from oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation. This could be beneficial by reducing levels of oxidative stress and preventing complications in patients with heart disease and diabetes (Jain et. al., 2002).
Amino Acid Metabolism:
Transamination reactions of amino acids leading to corresponding alpha-keto acids requires the presence of the coenzyme PLP to catalyze the required deamination and dehydration reactions in the presence of beta-hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups (Meister, 1965). Since PLP has a major role in amino acid metabolism, studies suggest that vitamin B6 requirements are affected by protein consumption (Vit, 1998).
Cancer and Vitamin B6:
High intakes of vitamin B6 has been found to be significant at preventing cancer.  Moreover, it has also been found that intakes of vitamin B6 in cancer patients could help them improve their immune system and prevent further progression to other stages (Vanderschuren et. al., 2013; Choi & Friso, 2012).
8.6.3 Requirements
[
]
Vitamin B6 requirements vary throughout the world and there are no exact amounts for these requirements.  Typically, the recommended amount of pyridoxine needed by the body depends on age and also an individual’s protein intake.  Requirements can be calculated using information about an individual’s age, along with using information about the protein intake.  The current Recommended Daily Allowances for vitamin B6 is between 1.5 to 2.2 milligrams per day (NCBI, 1).  The National Center for Biotechnology Information has discovered that to meet the minimum Recommended Daily Intake of vitamin B6, which is 1.5 milligrams per day, 11 milligrams for every one gram of protein is needed.  Vitamin B6 requirements are related to protein intake because the vitamin is involved in many functions of proteins in the body, such as amino acid metabolism.  It also is involved in the production of some hormones or neurotransmitters, which will incorporate protein function as well.  Therefore, when calculating the required intake for vitamin B6, it is important to relate the required amount to protein intake for optimal body function.
	Based on an individual’s age, vitamin B6 intakes increase throughout life.  The Recommended Dietary Allowance amounts of infants include: 0.1 milligrams for infants from birth to six months of age, 0.3 milligrams for infants seven to twelve months of age, 0.5 milligrams for one to three year olds, and 0.6 milligrams for children aged four to eight years of age (NIH).  The Recommended Dietary Allowance amounts for children and teens include: 1.0 milligram for nine to thirteen year olds and 1.3 milligrams for males aged fourteen to eighteen and 1.2 milligrams for females aged fourteen to eighteen (NIH).  The Recommended Dietary Allowance amount for adults aged nineteen to fifty is 1.3 milligrams (NIH).
	The requirements for vitamin B6 are higher in individuals who are pregnant, lactating, or over fifty-one years old.   The Recommended Dietary Allowance amount for individuals over the age of fifty-one is 1.3 milligrams per day (NIH).  For pregnant women, the Recommended Dietary Allowance amount is 1.9 milligrams, and for women who go through lactation the Recommended Dietary Allowance amount is 2.0 milligrams per day (NIH).
	These required amounts of vitamin B6 necessary for optimal body function can be obtained from the diet and from dietary supplements.  Foods that can be incorporated into the diet to obtain vitamin B6 are chickpeas, liver, tuna, and salmon (NIH).  Supplements with vitamin B6 in them can be taken orally by capsules or in a liquid form.   The body absorbs supplemental vitamin B6 efficiently, however it can be quickly lost from the body through urine (NIH).  Vitamin B6 should be obtained primarily through the diet and also through supplements for optimal absorption.
8.6.4 Deficiency
[
]
A deficiency in vitamin B6 is a rare occurrence. However, deficiencies do still appear in mild and high-risk forms. They can be seen in all age groups, mainly in children and the elderly. There are several symptoms associated with vitamin B6 deficiency:
•	Muscle weakness
•	Nerve damage
•	Difficulty contracting
•	Short-term memory loss
Vitamin B6 deficiency can be caused by a decrease in intake, alcohol consumption, or medications. Vitamin B6 is used in vitamin B12 absorption and the production of red blood cells as well as immune system cells (Ehlrich, 2015). Low levels of vitamin B6 can lead to death if your body is not able to produce the necessary cells to sustain life.
It is very rare to see an individual with vitamin B6 deficiency caused by food consumption. The availability of abundant food sources makes it difficult for someone to consume insufficient amounts of vitamin B6. Consuming fresher and nutrient denser foods can ameliorate the situation.
Alcohol consumption has a great effect on vitamin B6 levels in the body. Its main effect on vitamin B6 is the destruction or complete loss of the vitamin. Individuals with chronic alcohol abuse frequently exhibit lowered plasma levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the coenzyme form of vitamin B6 (Li, Lumeng, & Vech, 1975). Alcohol’s effect on the low level of PLP is due to the removal of PLP from its enzyme. As a result, PLP is dissolved and removed from the body. Decreased PLP concentration lowers the amount of vitamin B6 available resulting in a deficiency that can cause the several symptoms that were listed above.
Certain medications can also lead to vitamin B6 deficiency. For instance, the drug isoniazid decreases levels of the vitamin dramatically. Vitamin B6 supplementation during isoniazid therapy is necessary to prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy (Snider, 1980). One who takes this medication can benefit from preventing the growth of tuberculosis bacterium. However, the same drug can interact and bind with vitamin B6 and cause inactivation. This inactivation results in an overall decrease of vitamin B6 and eventually lead to vitamin B6 deficiency symptoms such as nerve damage. One who must take this medication can simply increase their vitamin B6 level by taking supplements.
It is extremely uncommon to find an individual in the United States with vitamin B6 deficiency because most Americans consume enough meals to nourish their bodies with adequate amounts of the vitamin. Most deficiency cases can be observed in developing countries. In certain parts of the world, particularly in Thailand, low intakes of vitamin B6 may be responsible for bladder stones (“Human nutrition,” n.d.). In developing nations, insufficient vitamin B6 intake is caused by the lack of nourishing foods that contain this vitamin.
8.6.5 Toxicity
[
]
Over time it has been concluded that vitamin B6 toxicity is not usually found when digested from food sources in the diet, the cases of toxicity most often stem from supplementing the vitamin B6. (LPI Outreach Education Fund, 2015) Being that vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin it’s assumed that the vitamin would be excreted before having the opportunity to reach toxic levels in the body. However, through supplementation, you are able to take vitamin B6 at a frequency and quantity in dosage that does not allow your body to expel it quickly enough. Some of the symptoms that accompany vitamin B6 toxicity, include: depression, fatigue irritability, headaches, nerve damage, and skin lesions. (Whitney & Roles, 2013) Specifically, nerve damage may bring about issues such as: difficulty walking, numbness, progressive sensory ataxia, impairment of position and vibration senses, and deficiencies in the sense of touch; temperature; and pain. (Larry E. Johnson, 2015) The lowest dosage given to humans that caused damage was 10 mg per day. (Chaudary, Porter-Blake, & Holford, 2015) Also according to the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine, sensory nerves will not be affected at a dosage of less than 200 mg per day. In ‘Understanding Nutrition,’ they state the earliest recorded case of vitamin B6 toxicity in the early 1980s. “This report described neurological damage in people who had been taking more than 2 grams of vitamin B6 daily for 2 months or longer.” (Whitney & Roles, 2013) The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin B6 at 100 mg/day for adults. There have been a variety of studies that show vitamin B6 being successful in treating ailments, including: morning sickness, PMS symptoms, Tardive dyskinesia, and more. (University of Maryland Medical Center, 2015) Nevertheless, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center more research is still necessary in almost each case, where some studies have shown no effect with the supplementation of B6.
While supplementing vitamin B6 can be done safely, in the case of a deficiency, it is important to be sure that you are replenishing the right vitamin and talking with a physician before self-medicating.

Vitamin B6
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Pantothenic acid
Vitamin C
8.7 Pantothenic Acid
[
]
Pantothenic acid can be alternatively known as vitamin B5, panthenol and pantothenate. This vitamin has a molecular weight of 476.56 and is the amide formed between pantoate and beta-alanine. They are found in small quantities in nearly every food, hence its name which was derived from a greek word 'pantothen' (meaning everywhere). Pantothenic acid is found throughout living cells in the form of co-enzyme A (CoA),a vital component of co-enzyme A in numerous chemical reaction (Ravipors, 2011). CoA is required for chemical reactions that generate energy from food (fats, carbohydrates and proteins). The synthesis of essential fats, cholesterol and steroid hormones requires CoA, as does the synthesis of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine and the hormone, melatonin (Gropper S.S, et al., 2009).
8.7.1 Sources
[
]
Pantothenic acid is abundant in the food supply, though the richest sources include meat products particularly organ meats (liver, kidney, heart), fish, and egg yolks.  Relative to animal muscle, humans store twice as much pantothenic acid in their muscles (Kimura S. et al. 1980).  Plant sources of pantothenic acid include whole grains, particularly in the hull of cereal grains. It is found in almost all vegetables such as broccoli and avocados. Brewers yeast and wheat germ are good sources, as is royal jelly (Combs G.F., 2008).
Pantothenic acid is found in nearly every food. Good sources of pantothenic acid include liver, kidney, egg yolks, shellfish, yeast, avocado, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, and whole grains. However, it is sensitive to food processing. Refining whole grains, freezing, and canning food may result in a 35% to 75% loss. It is, however, fairly stable in cooking.
8.7.2 Functions
[
]
Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble B vitamin essential for growth. It is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, lipids, steroid hormones, and hemoglobin. It is part of the chemical structure of coenzyme A, making it a critical vitamin in metabolism, specifically the TCA cycle of cellular respiration.
Found in all living cells, some health functions of Pantothenic acid include:
•	Synthesize cholesterol
•	Form red blood cells
•	Form stress and sex hormones
•	Break down all macronutrients (Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) for energy
Pantothenic acid is also used in some shampoos to restore natural color to graying hair.
8.7.3 Requirements
[
]
There is not enough evidence for an RDA for Pantothenic acid. Below is a list of the Adequate Intake (AI) based on age.
•	Age 0–6 months: 1.7 milligrams per day (mg/day)
•	Age 7–12 months 1.8 mg/day
•	Age 1–3 years: 2 mg/day
•	Age 4–8 years: 3 mg/day
•	Age 9–13 years: 4 mg/day
•	Age 14 and older: 5 mg/day
8.7.4 Deficiency
[
]
Deficiency in this B vitamin is rare, since it is found in nearly all foods. Those at risk for deficiency are individuals with severe alcoholism. Heavy alcohol consumption interferes with the metabolic processing of pantothenic acid. Deficiency in Pantothenic most likely occurs in conjunction with other B vitamins. However, soldiers in Japan during WWII were effectively relieved of the burning sensation of their feet by pantothenic acid supplementation, not by other B vitamins. Signs and symptoms include neurological disturbances, gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, depression, and burning feet.
8.7.5 Toxicity
[
]
No UL for this vitamin has been established. No toxic effects have been reported. However, diarrhea can result in intakes of 20g/day of calcium D-pantothenate. In experiments done with mice, the LD50 was 10 g/kg, resulting in death from respiratory failure.

Vitamin C is a water soluble, organic compound that is essential for a variety of the human body’s functions. Humans cannot produce it endogenously so it must be obtained through our diet. Vitamin C is found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, making deficiency rare. Below is a list of foods that contain vitamin C.

Vitamin C is very fragile. It is  oxidized immediately upon contact with air and destroyed when exposed to light (ultraviolet rays). The heat of cooking destroys vitamin C. The exact temperatures at which the vitamin is destroyed varies based on the food it is in and the cooking method applied. Fortunately, most of the foods that contain this compound are consumed raw. Generally, consumption of two to three servings of fruits and three to five servings of vegetables per day will be enough vitamin C to meet the recommended daily intake established by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Their recommendations are 90 mg for men over the age of 18 and 75 mg for women daily.
8.8.2 Functions
[
]
Chemically, vitamin C is known as L-ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is an enzymatic cofactor involved in a number of physiological reactions. It is required in the synthesis of collagen and red blood cells and helps the immune system by maintaining the integrity of the epithelial cells. It also plays a role in iron absorption. Its use is therefore not recommended for people with iron overload, as is the case in people with hemochromatosis. The oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid, crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain and multiple organs. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant molecule that can counteract the harmful effects of free radicals. Free radicals are harmful compounds in the body that are spontaneously formed when oxygen interacts with certain molecules. They can also be found in air pollution, cigarette smoke, and UV light . The buildup of free radicals in the body over time is partly responsible for the aging process. Vitamin C’s antioxidant abilities greatly enhance cell functioning and play a vital role in wound healing. Additionally, vitamin C role in the regeneration of other antioxidants such as vitamin E. Vitamin C is also important in the eye’s ability to deal with oxidative stress. It has been shown to delay the progression of age related vision loss and macular degeneration. Other functions of vitamin C include the role it plays in aiding the body in the production of collagen, a protein that helps heal wounds and gives structure to muscles and other tissues. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and is found in all connective tissue in the body. As vitamin C builds up the collagen in the skin, bones, organs and blood vessels, it enables the body to function successfully. By maintaining the integrity of the skin- humans first line of defense- and quashing free radicals, vitamin C improves the immune system’s functioning. Vitamin C also aids the body in the absorption of iron from foods that are plant based. Nonheme (plant based) iron is not as readily absorbed as heme iron so it is important to consume vitamin C to maximize absorption. Another major role of vitamin C in the body is to repair and maintain bones, teeth, and cartilage. This is apparent in people with scurvy, a major vitamin C deficiency, because they are usually very weak and have little to no teeth at all. Vitamin C is also useful in the metabolism of some bile acids which may effect the body’s production of gallstones and its blood-cholesterol levels . For a long time, vitamin C has been a recommended prevention method or treatment for the common cold. However, research shows that vitamin C does not cure a cold, but people who regularly take supplements of vitamin C might have slightly shorter colds or more mild symptoms. It can also act as an inhibitor of histamine, a compound that is released during allergic reactions. It has also been found to decrease or prevent the forming of possibly carcinogenic nitrosamines within the stomach . The body is not capable of making vitamin C nor can it be stored. That is why it is very important to make sure to consume foods containing vitamin C.
Overall, vitamin C has a broad range of functions throughout the body and is an extremely important part of the diet. These functions include immune stimulation, anti-allergenic action, eye health, iron absorption, teeth and gum health, would healing, antioxidant behavior, and collagen production.
8.8.3 Requirements
[
]
European guidelines advise a daily intake of 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men. For example, an orange give an average of 53 mg of vitamin C (40 to 80 mg per 100 g).
The North American Dietary Reference Intake recommends 90 milligrams per day and no more than 2 grams (2,000 mg) per day.
The people who is exposing to the harmful effects of oxidants, such as smokers have an increased need for vitamin C. Some scientists like Linus Pauling (Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954), consider that the recommended dietary intake should be at least 6000 mg, or 18 000 mg.
8.8.4 Deficiency
[
]
A major deficiency of vitamin C, very rare, causes scurvy, when the supply is less than 10 mg per day. The more discreet hypovitaminosis are widespread and result in fatigue, weight loss, headache, bone pain, increased susceptibility to infections and sometimes bleeding problems.
Symptoms of deficiency in this area are rare. There are several common signs of Vitamin C deficiency that can be observed. It includes anemia, which is the lack of adequate red blood cells or in some cases hemoglobin in the blood, gingivitis, bleeding gums, failure to overcome infections and a slower healing rate, more frequent bruising, increase in weight, rough and scaly skin, inflamed joints, and the weakening of tooth enamel.
In extreme and rare circumstances a lack of vitamin C leads to Scurvy or atherosclerosis. Scurvy is a disease most commonly found in older adults, and consists of the degradation of all joints, tendons, and blood vessels. Ultimately, this leads to vessel erupting, hemorrhages, and organ failure. This is due to the lack of collagen protein and connective tissue in the body that is formed majorly through vitamin C.
Atherosclerosis is a condition where the body’s arteries are progressively filled with hardening plaque in arteries and blood vessels ultimately closing in the arteries and preventing oxygen flow throughout the body.
Linus Pauling Theory
Linus Pauling, American scientist and recipient of two Nobel Prizes, proposed that heart disease could be treated and by increasing vitamin C intake. He hypothesized and found that heart disease was another form of scurvy and the plaque that gradually builds up in the body’s arteries and blood vessels were formed to help the body heal those vessels.
Antioxidants and Redox Signaling
In the study
Antioxidants and Redox Signaling
, researchers looked into how deficiencies in vitamin C led to severe damage in developing brains and motor behaviors. They theorized that the speed of the brain developing would be affected by the lack of an antioxidant system, which vitamin C contributes greatly to.  After testing neonatal Gulo mice, the results showed that without vitamin C, growth was at a significantly lower rate and many brain deficiencies including a delay in the formation of cerebral fissures, abnormalities in areas such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, and a change in purkinje cells. The change in purkinje cells led to mice facing a decline in their overall motor skills. The researchers concluded that in new born babies vitamin C deficiencies cause hemorrhages and cerebellum defects. This deficiency also leads to damage in the cerebellum in individuals with full developed brains, including basic function impairment.
To resolve and avoid these vitamin C deficiencies one should increase their daily intake to the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) preferred amount.
8.8.5 Toxicity
[
]
Vitamin C is not toxic at doses usually absorbed for a healthy individual.
Since its synthesis in the 1930s, vitamin C is used at all doses throughout the world. The only side effects associated with its use and that are developed are mild diarrhea and diuretic action. These occur when consumed too quickly and too much. The body can not store it, it eliminates excess.
Clinical studies show:
the consumption of vitamin C does not increase
·
·
and even reduces
the incidence of kidney stones.
that vitamin C has no mutagenic effect (study of doses up to 5000 mg per day)
·
.
In vivo studies show that vitamin C, even in the presence of transition metals has no mutagenic effect and instead it protects the cells of the mutagenic action of hydrogen peroxide.
Symptoms of an overdose of vitamin C may include: nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, and asthenia.
For doses greater than 500 mg/day , an increase of production of oxalic acid could induce a risk of kidney stones oxalate. This side effect is controversial in some studies. Indeed, plants that provide vitamin C also bring oxalate , hence the confusion.
Vitamin C: 8.8.5 Toxicity
Vitamin C is rather an uncommon vitamin to overdose on, especially from its natural foods. Vitamin C toxicity normally occurs due to taking too many supplements. Vitamin C Toxicity cannot lead to death though and anything above the recommended amount of 2,000 mg of Vitamin C can lead to the below symptoms. The common symptoms that can occur from Vitamin C toxicity are:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Heartburn
Abdominal Bloating and cramps
Headache
Insomnia
Kidney Stones
Diarrhea
Consuming more than 2000 mg of the recommended intake of Vitamin C can lead to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to diarrhea and also vomiting can occur as well.   As a result of the toxicity causing diarrhea and vomiting, one can lose a significant amount of fluids leading to dehydration, fatigue, low urine discharge and a reduction in blood pressure.
Vitamin C’s effects on other minerals
Copper: Pink eye or inflammation of the eyelids is caused by copper deficiency. When consuming too much vitamin C, which leads to a huge increase in high ascorbic, coupled with copper deficiency in the body can either cause the inflammation or make it worse. Chronic conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, can occur due to Vitamin C toxicity depleting the cooper storage quickly.
Zinc: Vitamin C within the body has direct effects on Zinc and Zinc indirectly affects Iron. As a result a high Vitamin C toxicity would lead to worsened liver conditions, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or kidney diseases.
Manganese: Large intake of Vitamin C can lead to insulin spikes which can affect people with hypoglycemic tendencies and have low sodium. Vitamin C toxicity can also affect the length of a woman's menstrual cycle because manganese has control over the liver’s ability to break down estrogen.
Kidney Stones:
A substance in our body called oxalate breaks down Vitamin C and when we urinate, we secrete some oxalate. High urinary oxalate levels can build up causing deposits which are also known as kidney stones. Vitamin C toxicity is correlated with increased risk of kidney stones, and about 80 percent of all kidney stones are caused by Vitamin C toxicity.
Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a condition caused by excess iron build-up in the body. Within our body, Vitamin C helps absorb iron, and while Vitamin C toxicity does not cause Hemochromatosis, it can worsen the condition.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Sodium
Chloride
9.1 Sodium
[
]
Sodium is an element that is crucial for the body to function properly. The most common places that sodium can be found is in table salt as well as processed meats, processed foods, and fast food. The main functions for sodium in the body are for control of blood pressure and for correct functioning of the muscles (Chen, Zieve, Ogilvie, 2015). Other functions include the conduction of nerve impulses and proper balance of minerals and water (Harvard School of Public Health). On the molecular level, sodium is used in sodium-potassium pumps which actively transports ions across the cell membrane (Nave). Although sodium is important for proper bodily functions, the body only needs a small amount to function (American Heart Association, 2014). Since sodium is found in many food sources, and it is easy to have too much sodium in the diet. It can also be difficult for people to control how much sodium they are consuming if they are eating out and not cooking their meals. On average, Americans consume about 3400 mg of sodium daily (American Heart Association, 2014). Too much sodium in the diet can lead to high blood pressure. Continuous high pressure can cause congestive heart failure, strokes, and kidney disease. It is recommended that healthy adults should limit their sodium intake to 2300 mg per day (Chen, Zieve, Ogilvie, 2015). For those adults with already high blood pressure, it is recommended that they consume less than 1500 mg per day. Additionally, as people age blood pressure naturally increases, therefore, older adults should be more aware about limiting their sodium intake to prevent further health issues (American Heart Association, 2014). In order to prevent these health issues, it is best to develop healthy eating habits by limiting sodium intake at a young age. These good habits can carry on into adulthood which can help individuals continue to lead healthy lives (Chen, Zieve, Ogilvie, 2015). One way to decrease sodium intake is by eliminating added salt from daily dishes, but this does not expel nearly enough salt from the diet to be considered healthy. Another way to reduce sodium intake includes eating more home-cooked meals instead of at restaurants or fast food, and to be more aware of sodium in processed foods. Reading and understanding the “Nutrition Facts” and the “Percent Daily Value” labels on all processed foods can easily determine whether or not you are consuming too much sodium in one meal (American Heart Association, 2014).
Around 85% of the sodium in your body is found in the blood and lymph fluid (Sodium in Blood). Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal gland that is partly responsible for the amount of sodium retained in the body. It tells the kidneys when to keep sodium in the body or excrete it through the urine (Sodium in Blood).

9.1.1 Sources
[
]
Sodium is found in a wide variety of foods consumed by the general population.  More often than not, sodium is found in foods that have undergone processing.  The top 10 sources of sodium are “breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, poultry, soups, sandwiches, cheese, pasta dishes, meat dishes, and snacks,” (Center for Disease Control and Prevention.)
The amount of sodium in a given product can be determined from reading the Nutrition Facts panel located on the food product package or box.  All nutrients will be listed here.  Sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). The amount of sodium can be rounded to the nearest 10 mg measurement for recording purposes. A good rule of thumb for determining whether or not to consume a product containing sodium is to not eat anything with more than 200 mg of sodium per serving (Shepell).  Do keep in mind that the serving size listed may be less than what a person would normally consume.
Beyond the label, sodium can be added to meals, especially in fast food chains and restaurant settings.  Sodium is thought to enhance flavors, but it also adds unwanted salt to the food product.  Sodium can be found in sneaky, hidden places too. Salt, being a large source of sodium in the diet, is not the only source of sodium.  Baking soda in the form of sodium bicarbonate adds sodium to many processed foods, especially baked products.  Flavor enhancers, for example MSG, as well as many preservatives also add unexpected sodium levels to food.
Shepell warns against labels such as “marinated, pickled, smoked or breaded” because they are essentially code names for added salt and high sodium food choices.
“A healthy adult should consume no more than 2,300mg of sodium a day (Thomas.)  This is the equivalent to about 1 teaspoon. However, most Americans consume a diet that contains much more than the recommended amount.  The excessive sodium consumption directly correlates to the increase in blood pressure in the American population.  One easy guideline to follow when trying to consume less sodium is to choose foods with less than 5 percent of the daily value as given on the nutrition facts for a 2,000-calorie diet." (The American Heart Association).
Luckily, taste buds in the mouth have a high turnover rate, so they can be “trained” to like new flavors.  By gradually lowering the amount of salt added to food, and transitioning to lower sodium alternatives, one can become independent of the amount of salt added to food.  Since salt becomes sodium in the body, this would directly decrease the amount of sodium in the blood and decrease blood pressure.  Some of the best flavors to substitute in place of sodium are “lemon, ginger, curry, dried herbs (such as bay leaves, basil and rosemary), onion, garlic and dry mustard,” (Thomas).
There are many sources of sodium lurking in our food.  In order to combat sodium, we must first know the places it hides.  By monitoring sodium content from reading the Nutrition Facts panel to limiting processed foods in the diet, huge cuts in the amount of sodium in our every day diets will have a huge impact on our health overall, especially blood pressure.

Humans take all the Sodium (Na) that we need in the form of salt. Edible, table salt is composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl),
Sodium:
Principal cation in extracellular fluid.
Helps to stabilize the potassium/sodium ratio
Regulates blood volume.
Regulates blood pressure.
Regulates osmotic equilibrium.
Regulates acid-base (pH) equilibrium.
Essential for nerve impulse transmission
In animals, sodium ions are used against potassium ions to build up charges on cell membranes, allowing transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is dissipated (Wikipedia).
Essential for muscle contraction.
In muscle movement, sodium channels open in the muscle cell and sodium ions (positively charged) rush into the muscle fiber (How Ion Channels…). This quick change in charge causes a brief electrical impulse to run throughout the fiber (How Ion Channels…). In nerve  impulses, an electric impulse is created in much the same way. A sodium channel allows sodium to enter that had previously built up outside of the cell (The Nervous System) .
Sodium plays an important role in pH balance throughout the body. It is part of the compound sodium bicarbonate, more commonly known as baking soda. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a pH buffer and helps to stabilize blood pH. Even though sodium is not active in buffering pH, the sodium binds to the bicarbonate, allowing it to move throughout the body (How Does Sodium…).
One important role of sodium is controlling blood volume. Another hormone that is important in balancing sodium levels as well as maintaining adequate amounts of fluid in the body is antidiuretic hormone or ADH. This hormone causes the kidneys to retain water and, as a result, increase blood volume (Overview of Sodium).

9.1.3 Requirements
[
]
The current recommendation for sodium intake is less than 1,500 mg a day.  The upper limit for sodium is 2,300 mg a day (American Heart Association). The recommendation is set lower as a safety precaution for people with high blood pressure. People that are at risk for high blood pressure such as people with hypertension, African Americans, and people of middle or older age should be careful not to consume too much sodium (American Heart Association). The average American consumes around 3,400 mg of sodium every day, well above the recommendation and upper limit for sodium intake (The FDA Recommended…). Athletes and very active individuals who may lose a lot of electrolytes through sweat, can consume more sodium than a non-active individual, but even they may not need more than 1,500 mg of sodium a day (The FDA Recommended…). Table salt or sodium chloride is made up of about 40% sodium (Sodium in Diet). One teaspoon of salt contains the upper limit of sodium, or 2,300 mg of sodium (Sodium in Diet).
As of May 2014, it is recommended by the American Heart Association that the average individual should consume less than 1500 mg of sodium per day. Extreme athletes or workers who are exposed to heat for prolonged periods of time should consume the maximum requirement of 1500 mg of sodium each day. This is to replace the large amounts of sodium that are lost with excessive sweating. The requirement is set at 1500 mg/day because this value is the best for maintaining a proper blood pressure.

9.1.4 Imbalance
[
]
When you consume food, you don’t think about the minerals and nutrients that you are
consuming. Man was made to eat, in order for the survival of its species. Yet
when it comes to cooking foods, it is important to monitor the ingredients added. Salt, otherwise known as sodium, is one of those ingredients that you have to control. A national survey showed that the average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams
per day (Pineo). That is a lot considering that the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is 1,500
milligrams per day (Palacios, 2013). There is even leniency for those that tend to consume more
with a limit of no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day (Palacios, 2013).
Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in the blood is lower than normal. This can become a problem because sodium is needed for the correct function of nerves and muscles and also to maintain blood pressure. Acute hyponatremia occurs quickly over a few days and is more dangerous than chronic hyponatremia, where the sodium level gradually decreases over time. This is because in chronic hyponatremia, the body’s cells have enough time to adjust to the swelling of water inside them. In extreme cases, hyponatremia can cause hallucinations, brain herniation, and/or death.
Symptoms.
Symptoms of hyponatremia include:
Confusion
Convulsions
Headache
Loss of appetite
Muscle cramps
Nausea
Vomiting
Weakness
Causes.
There are three different types of hyponatremia. These conditions vary depending on how the imbalance of sodium and water within the body occured. The first type is known as Euvolemic Hyponatremia. This type of imbalance occurs when the amount of water in the body increases, and the amount of sodium stays the same. The next condition is Hypervolemic Hyponatremia. This type occurs when the amount water and salt both increase in the body, but the amount of water increases more. The third and final type is Hypovolemic Hyponatremia. This occurs when the amount of sodium and water in the body both decrease, and the loss of sodium outweighs the loss of water.
Any one of these imbalances can be caused by physical factors, such as:
Large burns
Diarrhea
Heart Failure
Kidney Disease
Sweating
Vomiting
Diagnosis.
Hyponatremia can be diagnosed through blood and urine tests. The blood tests include running a whole comprehensive metabolic panel, as well as a blood osmolality test. The urine tests include that examination of the concentration of water and sodium in the patient’s urine.
Treatment.
In order to treat hyponatremia, the patient may be given an IV that contains sodium to directly correct their fluid imbalance. A patient may also be given medicine to help cure their symptoms. A patient may also be told to be cautious of their amount of water intake.
There is an understanding that people partake in different levels of activity and need to
consume more or less than average amounts of sodium. There is also an influence of culture and background that can influence opinions and preferences on foods. . Yet you do have to make sure that you do not consume too much, or too little, sodium in order to keep your blood cells from malfunctioning (Benjamin Wedro, 2015). Symptoms can lead to lethargy, swelling, or even a coma (Benjamin Wedro, 2015). There are methods in order to prevent a high or low
intake level. Eat more fresh foods, rather than processed products with excessive amounts of
sodium (Palacios, 2013). The types of seasoning that you use to cook also can easily be altered. Rather
than using sodium based products, use herbs like cilantro, garlic, onions, and lemon juice (Palacios,
2013). We all want to live healthy lives and the first step can be as small as watching the amount
of sodium you consume.

HYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA
The ideal concentration of sodium in blood plasma, for humans, lies between 135 – 145 mEq/L. (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2015)
Hyponatremia is a electrolyte disorder in which sodium levels, relative to blood plasma, are too low, falling below 136 mEq/L. This condition can be classified under three main categories. (Douglas, 2006) Euvolemic or isotonic hyponatremia occurs when total body water increases however sodium levels stay constant. Hypervolemic or hypertonic hyponatremia is defined as the increase of total sodium and water content in the body, however water levels increase more and at a faster rate. Finally, hypovolemic or hypotonic hyponatremia is defined as both total water and sodium levels dropping, however sodium loss is greater.
Hyponatremia can occur through any form of excess body water to sodium concentration within blood plasma. (Douglas, 2006) One potential cause is through water intoxication, such as by drowning or consuming too quickly, to the point of overwhelming the kidney’s ability to compensate and maintain body water equilibrium. Vomiting and diarrhea can also exacerbate hyponatremia in the case that a subject chooses to replenish his or her lost fluids without replacing lost electrolytes. Additionally, dysfunctional secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) can further disorder electrolyte balance. This is one of the most common causes of clinical euvolemic hyponatremia. (Douglas, 2006) Pneumonia, cancer, thyroid complications or certain medications can bring about a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). If the secretion of ADH is not properly regulated, water levels within the human body can build up.
Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, restlessness, and in extreme cases, nervous dysfunctions ranging from spasms and muscle weakness, to seizure and coma. (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2015)
Hypernatremia is a condition in which sodium levels are too high, reaching above 145 mEq/L. (Parrish & Rosner, 2014) Hypernatremia can occur through any form of unbalancing the water to sodium ratio within blood plasma, with an excess of sodium. One possible cause is dehydration, either by lack of thirst impairment or excessive sweat/water loss. It can also occur as a consequence of consuming too much sodium, or medicinal side-effects. Finally, hypernatremia can occur due to an endocrine disorder, such as diabetes, which causes a body to retain too little water. (Mayo Cinic Staff, 2015) Excessive expulsion of body water will lead to a higher and disordered total concentration of sodium. Clinically, patients will be especially at risk for hypernatremia if their sensation of thirst is altered, they are unconscious, or their water intake is dependent upon a caretaker or physician. (Parrish & Rosner, 2014)
Clinical symptoms of hypernatremia can include dysfunctions of CNS functionality. (Parrish & Rosner, 2014) This can manifest itself into confusion, stupor or in extreme cases, coma.

9.2 Chloride
[
]
Chloride is one of the major minerals in the human body and helps fluid levels in the body remain balanced by working closely with both sodium and potassium. Chloride works by maintaining fluid levels on the outside of cells in the body. Chloride is also an important contributor to the making of hydrochloric acid, an important digestive fluid, and can be found in the lining of the stomach (Chloride Requirements and Dietary Sources n.d). Chloride is an essential nutrient that occurs primarily in blood fluids. It has many roles in our body, so it is important that we get the proper amount of chloride in our diets. Chloride comes from the element chlorine (Cl2), which can exist as a poisonous gas. When chlorine reacts with sodium, potassium, or hydrogen, it forms the negative ion chloride (Cl-). This anion functions as an electrolyte.
Because it is an electrolyte, it plays an important role in the fluids throughout the body including lymph, blood, and the fluid found on the inside and the outside of cells (Chloride: The Forgotten Essential Mineral n.d). The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), which is the amount of a vitamin or mineral that an individual should consume in one day, for chloride varies from person to person based on age, gender, illness, and pregnancies. Most people ages 9–50 years old should consume about 2.3 grams of chloride per day and that amount will decrease for individuals that are outside of that age range (Institute of Medicine n.d). People must consume an adequate amount of chloride each day to compensate for the loss of chloride that happens daily through sweating and other releases of body fluids. Although it is important to have chloride in the body, it is also important to not have too little or too much, as it can be harmful. One of the main ways a person may experience a deficiency of chloride in the body is if the body loses a lot of fluids, in which case a person may experience dehydration and the associated symptoms. Having too much chloride in the body, which is associated with consuming too much salt in the diet, can lead to increased blood pressure and can cause the buildup of fluids in people with preexisting conditions like congestive heart failure or kidney disease (Chloride in diet: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia n.d).

Most people usually consume more chloride than needed, especially in America where there is an abundance of processed foods. Chloride is very easy to consume, as it is in most foods and can be added to any food as sodium chloride, which is table salt. However there are certain foods that contain more chloride than others, some of these are seaweed, celery, and olives (Chloride in diet: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia n.d). In the air, Cl2 forms and is in fact poisonous (Whitney, 2013). Chloride is abundant in processed foods due to the influx of salt added to them. NaCl is the molecular name for table salt. Foods with a high content of chloride include seaweed, rye, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, and olives. Unhealthful sources of chloride include yeast extract, processed lunch meats, and cheese. Chloride can also bind with potassium to form a salt substitute (times).
Chloride can be found in many foods as part of salts such as sodium chloride. Chloride is especially prevalent in processed foods, which are known to have extra added salt. However, many vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, celery, seaweed, and olives also contain chloride. The chloride consumed through the diet is absorbed by the intestine, and excess is excreted in urine, sweat, or bowels.

9.1.2 Functions
[
]
Chloride is considered an essential, major mineral of the body, requiring an intake of 2.3 grams per day. Being an essential nutrient, it is required for the body to function properly. Chloride has multiple important uses in the body. It is needed for fluid regulation and electrolyte balance. It is important for fluid regulation—if there is an excess of chloride ions in the blood, this leads to dehydration. It also helps to maintain decent blood pressure. Chloride can be found in the blood, being that it is the most abundant anion in the extracellular fluid. It can passively go into cells whenever needed, to interact with potassium. It is mostly ingested as table salt, paired with sodium. For this reason, it is easy to measure chloride levels in the blood as they are relatively the same as sodium levels. Chloride also helps the body maintain an acid-base balance from stomach acid, along with regulating cystic fibrosis transmembrane conducting regulators (CFTRs). If there are mutations or abnormalities in these regulators, cystic fibrosis can occur, along with major loss of water in the form of diarrhea, leading to an electrolyte imbalance in the body. Chloride also works in hydrochloric acid, a very strong acid and the main component in gastric juice. Its low pH allows for the breakdown of food—if it weren’t so acidic, this would not be possible and digestion would not occur as efficiently, if at all. Though this acid is beneficial for digestion, it can cause some problems with those prone to acid reflux or bulimia. This acid, if not treated properly with an antacid, can lead to wearing down of the esophagus or decaying of the teeth over time with frequent exposure.
The main function of chloride in the body is to maintain fluid balance. In humans, chloride makes up a large majority of the extracellular fluids (fluid outside of the cell). It is the major anion in the body, which also allows it to function as a principle electrolyte in our bodies as well. Chloride is very important for the electric potential difference across a cell’s membrane. Chloride is able to move passively across cell membranes bringing other nutrients with it. Outside the cell, chloride associates with sodium in order to maintain osmotic pressure of body fluids. Inside the cell chloride associates with potassium. Chloride also assists in the conduction of electrical impulses when paired with potassium or sodium. When dissolved, chloride becomes a negative ion while sodium and potassium become positive ions.
Chloride also plays a role in the stomach as the key digestive acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl). Hydrochloric acid maintains the acidity of the gastric juice and kills germs in our food. Hydrochloric acid lowers the pH of the stomach, making it more acidic, which then activates pepsinogen to pepsin. Pepsin is an important endopeptidase that breaks down proteins so they can be digested.

9.2.3 Requirements
[
]
Chloride is an essential or major mineral for humans and is considered an electrolyte. Suggested intake of chloride is between 750-900milligrams per day. Chloride recommendations are almost the same as sodium. The recommendations for chloride are higher than that of sodium. The average human body contains 115 grams of chloride. This means chloride makes up 0.15% of the total human body weight. Loss of chloride from the body happens when the body experiences diarrhea, heavy sweating, and/or vomiting. Too much blood chloride is only seen in cases of severe dehydration. Consuming ordinary foods that contain chloride can restore the chloride balance. Chloride deficiencies, although rare, can cause a life threatening condition called alkalosis. This condition refers to when the blood is overly alkaline. Symptoms of alkalosis include weakness, loss of appetite, irritability, and profound lethargy. An Excess intake of chloride results in water retention and high blood pressure. These side effects are due to the sodium and potassium that is always ingested along with chloride. Healthy individuals who consume enough water can tolerate large quantities of chloride.

The normal adult range for chloride is 97-107 mEq/L. It is recommended that healthy adults between the ages of 15 and 90 consume 2.3 grams of chloride per day in order to replace the amount of chloride lost each day due to sweating. Women who are pregnant or persons who are ill require a higher intake of chloride. The best way to get the suggested daily requirement of chloride is to plan for a diet that contains a variety of foods.

9.2.4 Imbalance
[
]
Because chloride is an electrolyte, an imbalance can lead to very serious results, especially when coupled with a disease such as cancer. However, it is very rare that our diets lack chloride because chloride is abundant in food. Nevertheless, chloride deficiencies can still occur as the result of other causes such as sweating, chronic diarrhea, and vomiting. Vomiting can cause a loss of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which can lead to an acid-base imbalance. Diuretics can also cause a low blood chloride level. Illnesses such as kidney and adrenal gland problems can also cause a low blood chloride level. Alkalosis is a life-threatening condition that results from a chloride deficiency. Symptoms of alkalosis include muscle weakness, loss of appetite, irritability, dehydration, and lethargy.
The only known cause of elevated blood chloride is dehydration. An elevated blood chloride level can result in an increased blood pressure along with a buildup of fluid in people with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney disease. Chloride toxicities have only been observed in humans with an impaired sodium chloride metabolism (e.g. congestive heart failure)

Chloride imbalance can affect the body’s ability to metabolize food sources efficiently and correctly (Chemocare, Hyperchloermia, 2015). Remember that chloride is an electrolyte and when electrolytes are dissolved in water, they disassociate into positive and negative ions (Chemocare, Electrolyte Imbalance, 2015). These charged ions move in and out of cells and affect the body’s nerve and muscle function (Chemocare, Electrolyte Imbalance, 2015). Chloride ions are negatively charged and must be balanced with positively charged ions when entering and leaving cells, and too much or too little chloride can cause an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance can lead to irregular heartbeat, confusion, muscle spasms, numbness, fatigue, and nerve or bone disorders (Chemocare, Electrolyte Imbalance, 2015). Imbalance can be caused by both high levels and low levels of chloride in the blood. The kidneys control acid-base balance in the body, and thus they determine the level of chloride in the blood (Yeung, 2014). The normal level of chloride in the blood of an adult is 97-107 mEq/L (Chemocare, Hyperchloermia, 2015).
Hypochloremia is a low level of chloride in the blood and it can be caused by body fluid loss— by continued vomiting diarrhea or sweating—or by the intake of drugs such as bicarbonates, corticosteroid, diuretics, and laxative (Chemocare, Hypochloremia, 2015). Hypochloremia can cause metabolic alkalosis, one of the most common electrolyte and fluid disorders (Palmer& Alpern, 1997). Metabolic alkalosis is a condition in which the blood contains an excessive amount of bases, throwing off its pH balance; it can be caused by a loss of acids or the presence of too much bicarbonate (Lewis, 2015). Symptoms include muscle cramps and spasms and irritability (Lewis, 2015).
Hyperchloremia is a condition in which there are high levels of chloride in the blood, and it can be caused by high levels of sodium in the blood, as well as body fluid loss (Chemocare, Hyperchloermia, 2015). Additionally hyperchloremia can be a direct effect of kidney failure or diabetes (Chemocare, Hyperchloermia, 2015). Intake of drugs such as androgen, corticosteroids, estrogens, and some diuretics can also induce hyperchloremia (Chemocare, Hyperchloermia, 2015). Hyperchloremia can cause metabolic acidosis, which is the converse of metabolic alkalosis (Yeung, 2014). Metabolic acidosis is an excessive presence of acids in the blood and a loss of bicarbonate from the blood (Lewis, 2015). As the acid increases in the blood, the body’s buffering system may not be able to handle the stress (Lewis, 2015). The blood pH drops, and the kidneys excrete more acid in the urine in an attempt to compensate (Lewis, 2015). Another mechanism that the body stimulates in order to combat the rising acidity of the blood is the regulation of breathing: the brain tells the body to breathe deeper and faster in order to increase carbon dioxide exhalation (Lewis, 2015). If both of these systems become too overburdened and fail, it can eventually lead to a coma (Lewis, 2015). Symptoms include fatigue, vomiting, and nausea, as well as, an increased rate of breathing (Lewis, 2015).

9.3 Potassium
[
]
Potassium is an essential mineral found inside the cells of our bodies. It is important for the proper function of all body cells, tissues, and organs. Specific roles include nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and muscle control (Potassium, n.d.). It is also an electrolyte, a substance that conducts electricity. Potassium levels are controlled by the kidneys and come from many different sources including banana and tomatoes (Micronutrient Information Center, n.d.).
9.3.1 Sources
[
]
Potassium can be found in a variety of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and meats. For example, foods with high levels (300 milligrams or higher) of potassium include baked potatoes with skin, dried plums, lima beans, yogurt, nonfat milk, chicken, canned tuna, and spinach (Micronutrient Information Center, n.d.). Foods with moderate levels (100-300 milligrams) of potassium include apples, peaches, lamb, broccoli, beets, ham, strawberries, and peas. Foods with less than 100 milligrams of potassium are bread, pasta, eggs, blueberries, bacon, corn, and black olives (Potassium and the Diet, n.d.).
9.3.2 Functions
[
]
Potassium function includes blood pressure regulation, muscle control, nerve impulse function, heart function, and electrolyte regulation. Its primary role is to regulate mineral and water balance throughout the body (Potassium and the Diet, n.d.).
The Sequence of Sodium-Potassium Pump
Potassium works with sodium to maintain a person’s blood pressure. As sodium accumulates in the blood, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium (Health Risks and Diseases, n.d.). This increases the amount of fluid around the cells and the volume of the blood in the bloodstream. The increased volume forces the heart to work harder and the pressure can harden blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Potassium have the opposite effect on blood vessels. High potassium levels can relax blood vessel and excrete sodium, which both lowers blood pressure (Health Risks and Diseases, n.d.).
Potassium plays a role in nerve conduction, specifically through the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump works to move three sodium ions out of the cell, while moving two potassium ions into the cell. There is a lower concentration of potassium ions outside the cell and a lower concentration of sodium ions inside the cell. Since the process requires active transport, the ions are moved across a membrane and against their concentration gradients; energy derived from ATP during cellular respiration is required (Nave, n.d.).
3 sodium ions are pumped out, while 2 potassium ions are  pumped in
In nerve cells, the generation of an action potential is required to transmit electrical signals. The action potential is brought about by changes in the penetrability of the axon cell to sodium and potassium.  The channels that allow sodium and potassium to pass through are voltage-gated. The channels remain closed when the cell membrane is at resting potential. An electric current can stimulate the channels to open, allowing sodium to flow in. Sodium ions flow inside in large quantities causing the charge on the inside of the cell to become more positive and results in depolarization. The sodium voltage-gated channels then close and the potassium ion channels open. Potassium moves out of the axon cell allowing the charge on the inside of the cell to become more negative, resulting in the repolarization of the cell. The sodium-potassium pump moves ions in either direction continuously so that many action potentials can be generated (Jones, Fosbery, Gregory, & Taylor, 2013, p. 319).
Potassium also functions to maintain pH levels. Sometimes, an individual can enter an alkalotic state where there is excess of base in the body fluids or tissues that can in turn produce weakness or cramps. The amount of hydrogen in the extracellular fluid is low during alkalosis, so the cells will release hydrogen to increase acidity. As a result, blood serum potassium is absorbed and its level drops.  Overall potassium levels are stable, but it is the serum potassium that is affected. Should the level of serum potassium drop below 3.5 mEq/L, the individual is expected to exhibit symptoms of hypokalemia derived from the initial alkalotic condition (Vroman, 2011).
Potassium can help regulate water retention as well. An individual may develop edema, a condition where watery fluid accumulates in tissues and cavities throughout the body causing it to swell.  Excess water is most commonly stored around the legs, feet, and ankles. Edema can be caused by overindulging in sodium. Potassium is able to combat sodium’s effects since consuming more potassium causes sodium to be removed from the body through urine. Even though potassium can reduce water retention, excess potassium in the blood can also be detrimental to an individual’s health (McNight, 2015).
9.3.3 Requirements
[
]
The adequate intake (AI) levels for potassium established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine is categorized by age and sex (Micronutrient Information Center, n.d.). For infants between ages 0–6 months, the recommended AI levels for potassium is 400 milligrams (mg) for both males and females. For children between 1–3 years old, 3,000 mg is adequate for both males and females.  For children between ages 4–8, the AI is 3,800 mg. For children between ages 9–13, 4,500 mg is adequate. Adolescents between 14 years old and older for both male and female need about 4,700 mg (Micronutrient Information Center, n.d.). The difference between male and female is when the female is breast-feeding. The female needs more potassium (5,100 mg) to accommodate for their baby (Potassium and the Diet, n.d.).
9.3.4 Imbalance
[
]
Most people get their recommended levels of potassium from their diets. However, potassium imbalances and the consequences of an imbalance can still occur. For example, hypokalemia is a medical term for low levels of potassium with symptoms of muscle cramps, bloating, intestinal paralysis, weakness, nausea,  upset stomach, and an irregular heartbeat. Hypokalemia can be life threatening and should be treated by a professional or doctor (Potassium, n.d.). Some causes of low potassium levels include use of diuretics, kidney diseases, metabolic disturbances, or excessive vomiting. The use of diuretics, severe vomiting or diarrhea, alcoholism, laxative abuse, eating disorders, and congestive heart failure are all conditions that increase the risk of hypokalemia (Micronutrient Information Center, n.d.).

9.4 Water
[
]
Water is considered the nutrient of life as one can go longer without food than they can without water. The human body relies on adequate internal water supply to function and maintain daily processes. Water contributes to approximately 60% of the body’s weight and is found in the skin, muscles, organs and bones. The muscles contain about 75% water, and fat contains about 25% of water, thus body composition can have an impact on the amount of water within the body. Females, the elderly, and those who are obese tend to have a lower water percentage in the body. About two-thirds of the water in the body is found inside the cells and is known as intracellular fluid.  Extracellular fluid, or fluid outside of the cells, is made up of plasma and interstitial fluid, which is water surrounding the tissue cells.
9.4.1 Sources
[
]
The body is supplied with water from drinking fluids, eating food and through body metabolism processes. It is estimated that daily intake of water is represented by:
Liquids: 550 to 1500 mL
Foods: 700 to 1000 mL
Metabolic byproduct: 200 to 300 mL
Water consumption should equal the amount excreted by the body to maintain water balance. The body rids itself of water through waste disposal in the urine, vapor in the lungs, sweat from the skin, and small amounts in the feces. Though the average amount of water lost a day is 2500 milliliters, the minimum amount that the body must excrete is 500 milliliters for the disposal of waste and toxins, and any amount above this is to preserve water balance. The best source of fluids is from water itself, as it doesn’t contain any unhealthy or unneeded additives such as caffeine, alcohol, or added sugars.
9.4.2 Functions
[
]
Water is used in nearly every major body system. The functions of water include the following:
Regulating body temperature: When the body rises and becomes too warm, the blood vessels dilate to release heat into the environment, and the skin releases ions and water from the skin as sweat to draw away heat. When the body temperature falls and becomes too low, the blood vessels contract and tighten to retain heat, and shivering begins.
Maintaining moisture in the tissues and membranes
Lubricating joints
Protecting body tissues and organ systems
Flushing waste products out of the body and softens stool
Dissolving minerals and nutrients in the body allowing for easy transportation
Carrying oxygen and nutrients to cells in the body
Serving as a chemical reactant in body systems
Maintaining blood volume
Maintaining the Acid-Base Balance: the acidity of the body depends in the concentration of hydrogen ions. Water can either dilute or increase this concentration in order to maintain balance.
Medium for Metabolism: Water can either participate in the metabolic reactions (mainly catabolic reactions), or it can act as a medium for the metabolic reaction to occur in
9.4.3 Requirements
[
]
Water requirements are difficult to establish as they can vary by numerous factors, including but not limited to, a person’s weight, environment and activity level. Water recommendations are generally based on the amount of energy expended. For adults, 1.0 to 1.5 mL/kilocalorie expended will help the body maintain water equilibrium. This equates to two to three liters (approximately 68 to 100 ounces) for a 2,000-calorie diet. Another recommendation for water intake is one-half cup per 100 kilocalories expended, equating to 80 fluid ounces based on a 2,000-calorie diet. Adequate intake levels for males are listed at 3.7 liters per day and 2.7 liters per day for females.Beverages supply about 75-80% of the daily amount, while the remaining 20-25% comes from the water within food products. Water can also be produced in the body through metabolic reactions, but this amount is less than what is found in the food and water sources. Water should be consumed throughout the day in regular intervals, as thirst can be an unreliable method of determining the amount of water the body needs.
9.4.4 Imbalance
[
]
Dehydration happens when the body’s water content falls below adequate levels. This can happen naturally when the body expels water at higher rates than the rate at which an individual takes in water. For example, water is naturally expelled from the body through the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract by excretion. It is also expelled through the skin as perspiration, as well as through the lungs as exhalation. Some individuals should be more conscious of their water balance, as they may at a higher risk for dehydration. This group includes the elderly, as they have a poor thirst response, as well as infants, as they are prone to frequent diarrhea and vomiting. Certain illnesses, such as the flu or a bacterial infection can cause one to expel more water than normal as a result of fever and/or diarrhea. Thus, an individual should consume more water to maintain a healthy balance of fluids in the body.
The following chart outlines the effects of dehydration as water levels, represented by body weight percentage, decreases.
Body Weight Loss (%): Symptoms
1-2
:	Thirst, exhaustion, weakness, sense of discomfort, decreased appetite
3-4
:	Diminished physical performance, dry mouth, decrease in urine, reddened skin, intolerance, apathy
5-6
:	Difficulty concentrating, headache, petulance, drowsiness, compromised temperature regulation, increased respiratory rate
7-10
:  Vertigo, spastic muscles, loss of balance, disorientation, fatigue, collapse
In rare cases, a person can consume too much water. This is known as water intoxication, or hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia occurs when sodium levels in the blood plummet to a dangerously low level. This condition can develop through a number of different ways, including excessive water consumption, decreased urine production due to kidney disease, or extreme or prolonged (longer than three hours) times of sweating without electrolyte replenishment. Symptoms of hyponatremia can consist of confusion, convulsions, and in extreme cases it can result in death.Symptoms of hyponatremia can range from mild manifestations, like fatigue, headache, or nausea; to extreme, where the cells in the brain begin to swell, which often results in hyponatremic encephalopathy. To prevent hyponatremia, individuals should drink water in limited amounts (1-1.5 liters an hour) during times of heavy sweating and exercise, eat salty foods during long durations of endurance training, and consume a healthful, balanced meal after exercise or excess sweating.
Regulation of Body Water
[
]
The body can maintain fluid balance through the detection of blood pressure, blood volume, and the concentration of sodium and other ions. When blood volume and blood pressure fall too low, or whenever the concentration of extracellular fluid has become too high, the hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland to secrete the antidiuretic hormone, ADH. ADH then stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb water, and to only excrete highly concentrated waste as needed. This process also promotes the thirst mechanism. When water is then consumed or reabsorbed, the blood pressure and blood volume rise again, and the concentration of the blood solutes is diluted. Another response to dehydration and low blood pressure is the secretion of Renin by the kidneys. Renin, through a series of steps, causes the kidneys to reabsorb sodium, which, in turn, causes water reabsorption. In addition to this, Renin hydrolyzes the protein Angiotensin to Angiotensin I. Angiotensin I then remains inactive until it travels to the lungs, where it is hydrolyzed into Angiotensin II. Angiotensin II works as a potent vasoconstrictor, as it narrows the diameter of the blood vessels to raise blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal glands to release the hormone Aldosterone, which signals to the kidneys to retain sodium, and thus retain water.

10.1 Calcium
[
]
10.1.1 Sources
[
]
Calcium is a very important mineral in human metabolism, making up about 1-2% of an adult human’s body weight. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to eat dairy foods to get the calcium you need in your meal plan. (Calcium, n.d) Calcium is found most abundantly in milk, however for people that do not prefer to drink milk, calcium can also be found in high quantities in cheese and yogurt. There are plenty of other non-dairy options for fulfilling your body’s calcium needs. Tofu, corn tortillas, some nuts such as almonds, and some seeds such as sesame seeds all can supply calcium. A single slice of most breads contains only about 5-10% of the amount of calcium found in milk and dairy products, but by eating many of these types f food sources, the calcium adds up. Oysters and canned sardines are also good sources of calcium. Among the vegetables, those high in calcium include kale, watercress, mustard and turnip greens ,broccoli, parsley, and bok choy. As far as beverages go, some mineral waters, as well as calcium-fortified orange juice and other fruit and vegetable juices can provide up to 500 milligrams of calcium in one liter and allow you to obtain other vitamins and minerals as well.
10.1.2 Functions
[
]
Calcium is the single most abundant mineral found in the human body. 99% of the bodies calcium can be found in bones and teeth and the other 1% is present in body fluids. There are two crucial roles calcium plays in the body, “First, it is an integral part of bone structure, providing a rigid frame that holds the body upright and serves as attachment points for muscles, making motion possible. Second, it serves as a calcium bank, offering a readily available source of the mineral to the body fluids should a drop in blood calcium occur.”(Whitney/Rolfes, 2011. Pg. 400) We will now look at the function of calcium in bones, body fluids, disease prevention, and obesity.
•	Calcium in Bones:
As bones are growing and beginning to develop, calcium salts called hydroxyapatite crystallize on a matrix of collagen. During the process of mineralization the crystals of calcium salt become denser which in turn gives strength and rigidity to the developing bones.
•	Calcium in Body Fluids:
The mere 1% of calcium that is present in body fluids may not seem like much, however it is incredibly vital to life “The calcium in your body [fluids] plays key roles in cell signaling, blood clotting, muscle contraction and nerve function. Cells use calcium to activate certain enzymes, transport ions across the cellular membrane, and send and receive neurotransmitters during communications with other cells. As an electrolyte, or a particle that helps conduct electricity in the body, calcium is also one of the key players in maintaining regular heartbeat.”(Kamps, n.d.)
•	Calcium and Disease Prevention:
The research that has been done in regards to the correlation between calcium and disease prevention is inconsistent and inconclusive although, from what has been found calcium may play a role in preventing hypertension, diabetes and colon cancer and in lowering blood cholesterol.
•	Calcium and Obesity:
Again, studies have not been 100% conclusive however; there is some evidence that supports calcium aiding in maintenance of body weight. It has been found that consuming adequate amounts of dietary calcium may help to prevent excessive fat accumulation by stimulating hormonal action that targets the breakdown of stored fats.
Calcium is one of the many important major minerals, essential to a human body. According to Medline plus “Calcium is the most plentiful mineral found in the human body. The teeth and bones contain the most calcium. Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium.” Calcium helps us maintain bone strength and tooth structure while creating a foundation for skeletal function. While 99% of calcium helps make our bones strong, the other 1% plays an essential role in blood clotting, cell signaling, nerve impulse transmission and muscle contractions. Some of the best food sources for calcium are: Dairy products, Fortified foods, greens, and calcium-processed tofu. While consuming calcium, our body needs to make space for it in our body. Some food sources that will increase the absorption of calcium in our body include growth hormones, vitamin D, and Lactose. While making sure you get enough calcium for your body, you must not exceed the calcium intake for your body. Effects of calcium excess could result in increased risk of oxalate-type kidney stones or interference with absorption of other minerals. The recommended amount of calcium intake varies for each age group. From 14–18 years of age, the recommended calcium intake is 1300 mg/day. Between the ages of 19-50, the recommended intake is 1000 mg/day. For 50+ the calcium intake is 1200 mg/day. Since you have made sure you are not surpassing the calcium intake, you must make sure to meet the recommended value daily. If non-sufficient calcium is received in our bodies, it will lead to osteoporosis. According to Worth “By having an adequate intake of calcium, you’re giving your body the building blocks to fuel all its important functions, as well as to knit new bone tissue. If you don’t get enough calcium, the body will “steal” calcium that’s stored in bones to make sure it has enough to meet the body’s needs.” Calcium deficiency is not to be taken lightly as it affects total bone mass. Other effects of calcium deficiency are ineffective blood clotting and hypocalcemic tetany (muscle spasms). A person with minimal to no calcium in their system, can have excessive bleeding from cuts or slits or in rare cases, death. Most people automatically associate calcium with bone; which is not wrong, but should not be limited to one source. According to Kamps “Calcium can affect how your body absorbs and uses other nutrients. In nature, calcium carries a very small electrical charge, which is why it can conduct electricity within your body.”
10.1.2- Functions
Calcium, being the most essential mineral in the human body, is responsible for total body health. Along with total body health, calcium contributes to numerous functions in our bodies like blood clotting, nervous system functioning, enzyme function and strong bones and teeth. The body is regularly using calcium and its ions for the functions of the heart, blood, muscles, and nerves. (Evert, 2013) Also, calcium is known to prevent osteoporosis, a disease where bones become weak and brittle with age. Osteoporosis can lead to painful consequences like fractures of the spine and bones, causing pain and disability. (Wood, 2015) Researchers find, but it has not yet been proven valid, that calcium can also aid problems like PMS, high blood pressure, and weight gain. (Wood, 2015) Our bodies use almost all (99%) of the calcium we intake to support our bones, body structures, and teeth. This in turn, supports our bodies’ skeletal structure and how it functions. (Evert, 2013) Calcium helps the bones grow and remodel throughout a person’s life. Remodeling a process when the bones break down and are replaced with new bone. Without calcium, this important process would not occur. From birth to young adulthood, a person’s bones are in a constant growth phase. (Grossi, 2000) During this time, a person’s bones are increasing in size, length and width, so calcium is essential for proper growth. Also with the help of calcium, modeling occurs, which is the shaping of these growing bones. But calcium in the body can be lessened through every day bodily functions like waste/excretion, the shedding of hair and nails, and even perspiration. (Grossi, 2000)
The calcium that is not bone related, although it is a small amount, plays a key role in the functioning of the body. Calcium, plays a part in allowing our blood to clot by maintaining the solidity of fibrin. Additionally, expansion and contraction of blood vessels, hormones and nerve impulse transmission would not be functioning without the help of calcium. (Wood, 2015) Calcium is necessary for transmitting nerve impulses throughout the body along with various muscle contractions/relaxations. In our muscles, calcium ions are released to trigger the chemical reaction between myosin and actin. (Wood, 2015) This reaction then releases the energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is causes a contraction in the muscle. Then the ions that were released are retracted and the muscle then relaxes. This function, with the help from calcium, is especially vital to the function of the heart muscle and the way it contracts and relaxes. (Wood, 2015) Calcium is also has its involvement in brain development during the early stages of life and has the capability of regulating neuronal enhancement and can jump start adaptations in some brain cells. (Wood, 2015)
10.1.3 Requirements
[
]
The recommendation for how much calcium a person should consume has been set at an amount that will allow for a 30% absorption rate in the body. It is very important to get enough calcium in your diet as you are growing, this will ensure that the bones are all strong and dense. Calcium intake is generally high during the early years because bones are forming and then in the later years of life because bone loss begins. It is important to remember not to consume too much calcium, through the use of supplements for example, because this can have negative effects such as kidney stone formation.
10.1.4 Imbalance
[
]
In comparison to other nutrients calcium is very different in that regardless of the amount of calcium you obtain through your diet, blood calcium concentration remains relatively constant with the help of hormones. Blood calcium levels only change in response to abnormal regulatory control, NEVER diet. Maintaining calcium homeostasis involves the synchronization of hormones and vitamin D along with 3 important organs: the kidneys, bones and intestines. When blood calcium levels are too high this is considered calcium rigor, which results in muscles contracting and being unable to relax. Blood calcium levels that are too low is known as calcium tetany, which is characterized by uncontrolled muscle contractions. These increased or decreased levels are not caused by too much or too little dietary calcium consumption but rather by a lack of vitamin D in the diet or abnormal secretion of the regulatory hormones.
10.1.5 Deficiency
[
]
Calcium deficiency can cause significant development problems, especially in the years of high growth during childhood and adolescence (Committee on Nutrition, 1999). Low calcium intake during these years will not allow for maximal peak bone mass to develop. Peak bone mass is reached in the majority of people by their late 20s, but a calcium deficient person will struggle to develop this high bone density needed to protect against fractures and the bone loss that develops with age (Whitney & Rofles, 2016). In addition to problems developing later on in life, infants and children who are deficient in calcium have an increased risk of developing rickets. Low calcium in adolescents is a risk factor for bone fractures (Committee on Nutrition, 1999).
Insufficient calcium intake rarely causes immediate symptoms because the body is able to regulate its blood calcium levels by using the calcium in bone (“Calcium,” 2013), which contains 99% of the body’s calcium (Whitney & Rofles, 2016). Over time low bone mass, called osteopenia, will develop if the body is forced to continue getting its calcium from the bones. Bone loss with age is a normal occurrence, so people who are unable to develop peak bone mass and build dense bones earlier in life due to calcium deficiency will have less protection against this natural bone loss (Whitney & Rofles, 2016). This leads to osteoporosis in adults, where the bones are so weak and porous that they can break under a normal stressor (“Calcium,” 2013).
When blood calcium levels are abnormally low, ineffective blood clotting and calcium tetany can occur. Calcium tetany causes muscle spasms, which relates to calcium’s vital role in muscle contraction and relaxation. It is important to note that these conditions are not caused by a lack of dietary calcium. They are due to low vitamin D or a problem with regulatory hormone secretion, which results in a low blood calcium concentration (Whitney & Rofles, 2016). Calcium potentially protects against certain chronic diseases, so a deficiency could lead to an increased risk of developing a condition such as hypertension (Kaluza & coauthors, 2010; Reid & coauthors, 2010). In more extreme cases, the deficiency can cause a numb, tingling sensation in the fingers and even irregularities with the heart rhythm (“Calcium,” 2013).
It is important to remember that a diet low in calcium will negatively affect the bones, not blood calcium levels. As you learned above, if the body is not receiving enough dietary calcium, it will take what it needs to supply the blood from the bones. High calcium recommendations are set in place to not only provide the body with a sufficient calcium supply, but to ensure the bones will receive enough to be able to reach their peak bone mass (Whitney & Rofles, 2016).

Phosphorus can be found naturally in certain fresh foods and can act as an additive in the form of a phosphate salt.  Since phosphorus is a vital component of every single living organism, it can be found in a variety of foods. In processed foods, the phosphate salts are used for smoothness, binding, and moisture retention, which are all nonnutrient functions. This mineral can be found in protein rich foods. Some good sources of phosphorus that are high in protein are meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, poultry, legumes, cereal products and nuts (Intakes 1997). Other sources that are not high in protein, but still have a sufficient amount of phosphorus, are whole grains, dried fruits, carbonated beverages, and garlic cloves.  The RDA is split into the two categories. Children and adolescents ranging from the age of 9 to 18 years old have an RDA of 1,250 milligrams a day. Adults 19 years and older are required to have an RDA of 700 milligrams per day (Lpi. Orgeanstate.edu 2015). There are phosphorus supplements for those who do not meet the RDA's.  Multivitamin and mineral supplements that contain phosphorus make up around 108 milligams of the total daily intake. There are also supplements to treat hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia is a hereditary disorder in which the body begins to waste phosphate. This disorder requires medical supervision because strong sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate salts are used as supplements to treat this disorder (Ehrlich 2013). It can be hard for someone to calculate the amount of phosphorous intake they had for the day because some phosphorus that comes from food additives are not always integrated in food nutrient composition records.  Therefore the total amount of phosphorus consumed by a person in the United States can be undervalued by at least 20% (Intakes 1997). It is important to try to adhere to the RDA and not have an excessive amount of phosphorous intake because excess phosphorus can create changes in the body that withdraw calcium of the bones. High levels of phosphorus can also lead to threatening amounts of calcium deposits in the lungs, heart, eyes, and blood vessels (The National Kidney Foundation 2014). Eating fresh foods that are natural sources of phosphorous is suggested in order to maintain the proper RDA to contribute to ones overall health.
10.2.2 Functions
[
]
Phosphorus is one of the more commonly found minerals in the body. When combined with calcium, it creates calcium phosphate. Calcium phosphate is highly present in hydroxyapatite, a mineral that makes up the majority of a healthy bone structure. Hydroxyapatite gives bones their tough and stiff build. Even though the bulk of it may be found in bones (about 85 percent of it), it is also present in cells, making it extremely important and abundant in its functions in the body. It plays an imperative role in helping body tissues grow, maintain health, and repair when needed.
In addition to working together with calcium to ensure strong bones and teeth, phosphorus is vital in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is needed for energy storage and production. ATP is the molecule that produces and reserves energy for the body to use. It is considered the energy currency and dictates how the body uses carbohydrates, protein, and fats that are consumed. Phosphorus also synthesizes phospholipids, which makes up a large portion of cell membrane structures. It serves as a buffer to temper the acid-base balance (pH) of bodily fluids. Furthermore, phosphorus functions with the kidney as well as DNA and RNA. It sifts through waste in our kidneys to ensure they are healthy and operative. As far as working with deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid, it is needed for them to function normally. DNA and RNA produce proteins and amino acids for our body and without phosphorus, effective protein and amino acid synthesis would be compensated.
10.2.3 Requirements
[
]
Phosphorus is extremely essential in strong bone and teeth structure, especially in the early stages of a person’s life. The three most fundamental stages are during the time in the womb, child anabolism, and then during puberty when growth hormones are imperative. Recommended daily allowances are listed below:
•	0 to 6 months: 100 milligrams per day (mg/day)*
•	7 to 12 months: 275 mg/day*
•	1 to 3 years: 460 mg/day
•	4 to 8 years: 500 mg/day
•	9 to 18 years: 1,250 mg
•	Adults: 700 mg/day
Additionally, women who are pregnant, lactating, or postmenopausal should strive to consume more phosphorus in order to maintain a healthy balance of minerals in their bone mass, while also providing for the growing fetus.
Phosphorus deficiency is usually quite uncommon, as it is not hard to fulfill the daily recommendations with a regular diet. However, if phosphorus levels are to fall too low, symptoms can include but are not limited to softer bones, loss of appetite, and muscle fatigue.  On the other spectrum, overconsumption could be characterized by excessive diarrhea and hardening of organs. Toxicity also has the potential to obstruct other minerals needed for the body like zinc, calcium, magnesium, and more.

10.3 Magnesium
[
]
Magnesium is the twelfth element in the periodic table and is an essential mineral. Magnesium is necessary for proper functioning of the heart, kidneys, and muscles. The word “magnesium” itself comes from the region in Greece, Magnesia, where compounds of it occur naturally. Magnesium is the twelfth element on the periodic table and is presented in symbol form as Mg. The element takes many forms, having both physical and chemical properties. Not only is magnesium the ninth most abundant element in the world, magnesium is very abundant in our own body. On average twenty-five grams of magnesium are present in an adult body, mostly being found in bone and soft tissues. It is also naturally present in several foods, a dietary supplement, and an active ingredient in some medicines. With this, magnesium also plays a role in biochemical reactions, in which it is needed for more than 300 of these. These reactions include: blood glucose control, protein synthesis, nerve function, blood pressure control, and muscle function (NIH.gov, 2013). Currently, it is not recommend to add Magnesium supplements into a regular adults’ daily diet. The body receives adequate amount through dietary sources, although diets high in calcium, protein, or Vitamin D will increase the amount of magnesium needed. Magnesium deficiencies are possible, most occurring from lack of it in one’s daily diet (UMM.edu,2015).
10.3.1 Sources
[
]
Magnesium is an essential mineral (which means that we should acquire it in our diet because it is not produced naturally by our body) which our body needs so we could maintain efficient muscle and nerve function, for a strong immune system, maintaining healthy heart with normal rhythm, and building strong bones.
The body receives all of its magnesium through one’s daily diet. Since supplements are not required, it is essential that it is received through proper nutrition. The majority of dietary magnesium can be found in plant foods, whereas animal foods often have no magnesium content at all.
Magnesium works together with calcium in the body, both creating a balance. If one of these nutrients is in excess or deficient, it is guaranteed the other is as well. Magnesium deficiency symptoms are often seen when there is too much calcium in one’s body. It is important that both nutrients are equally ingested through one’s daily diet, thus promoting the balance between the two. Leafy greens are a vital way to receive adequate amounts of both magnesium and calcium. Nuts ( hazelnuts, pecans, almonds) and legumes (lima beans, soy beans, lentils) are both food sources containing requisite amounts of these nutrients.
Interestingly enough, both coffee and cocoa are great sources of dietary magnesium. Cacao just happens to be one of the richest sources of magnesium in the world. Cocoa contains most dietary magnesium when consumed in raw form. This would be in products, such as, cocoa powder and cocoa nibs. Not only is cocoa a great source of magnesium, it also an extreme antioxidant (Onegreenplant,2014).
Most ingredients of our everyday diet have good natural sources of magnesium. Interestingly, various natural sources of magnesium at the same time contain potassium. Examples are Leafy and green vegetables (spinach, broccoli), cereals (oatmeal, barley, crude oat bran, rye, buckwheat, brown rice, unrefined whole wheat grain), milk products (skimmed milk, yogurt), nuts (brazil, almonds, cashews, peanuts, pine, pecans), legumes (kidney beans, soy beans), fruits (bananas, raisins, dates, figs), fish (halibut, broiled and not fried as frying reduces magnesium content), beverages like cocoa and coffee, dried herbs (coriander, chives, spearmint, sage, basil and savory), dried seeds (squash, pumpkin and watermelon), cocoa powder (dark chocolate), flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, sesame butter (tahini, molasses and dry roasted soybeans.

10.3.2 Functions
[

Magnesium has been known to help maintain most of the body functions which regulate the vital processes of the heart for a healthy cardiovascular environment and bone density.
Its regulates of blood pressure, reduces the risk of type II diabetes, reduced risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases, reduced risk of osteoporosis,reduced migraine and alleviates the Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS).
Magnesium power our enzymes because it is crucial to more than 300 enzyme-driven biochemical reactions occurring in the body on a near constant basis.
Magnesium drives and maintains the balance of our fuel source because it is a required ingredient of the energy-production process that occurs inside the tiny structures within cells.
Magnesium plays a role in the protection of our DNA as DNA synthesis is slowed by insufficient magnesium.
Magnesium regulates your electrolyte balance. A proper balance of mineral content must be maintained within every cell in the body.
Magnesium contributes in the healthy balance (“homeostasis”) of important minerals (calcium, sodium and potassium) which affects the conduction of nerve impulses, muscle contraction, and heart rhythms.
Over 300 enzymes in the body require magnesium as a cofactor. These enzymes perform a variety of functions, which include including synthesizing protein, maintaining the proper function of nerves and muscles, regulating blood pressure, supporting a healthy immune system, and controlling blood glucose.
1,2
Magnesium is essential for glycolysis, energy production, and oxidative phosphorylation.
1,2
Additionally, it is necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis as well as the development of bone structure.
1,2
Magnesium is also vital for actively transporting potassium and calcium through cell membranes, processes that are vital for the conduction of a nerve impulse, the contraction of muscles, and the regular rhythm of heartbeats.
1,2
10.3.3 Requirements
[
]
Certain nutrients (supplements in particular) and stress conditions increase the need for Magnesium and thus it is very important to monitor one's food consumption and supplement intakes.
When the dietary intake of Magnesium was maintained at 250 mg/day, and Calcium was increased from low (200 mg/day) to high (1400 mg/day), negative Magnesium balance was observed and thus it is very important to increase Magnesium to 500 mg/day when Calcium is present.  A negative Magnesium balance was produced when Phosphate PO4 was increased from the near RDA level of 975 mg/day to 1500 mg/day.  Vitamin D reduces the Magnesium retention so Vitamin D should be avoided to allow Magnesium to be absorbed by the body.
10.3.4 Imbalance
[
]
Imbalance or Deficiency in Magnesium leads to the following:  low energy, fatigue, weakness, PMS/Hormonal imbalance, inability to sleep, bone weakness, muscle tension/spasm/cramps, abnormal heart rhythm, headaches, anxiousness/nervousness, irritability, kidneys stones, etc.
http://www.calmnatural.co.uk/magnesium-deficiency
Excess
In individuals with normal kidney function, high doses of magnesium from food sources are not shown to lead to hypermagnesemia, as the kidney maintains a homeostatic level of magnesium.
2
However, individuals with reduced kidney function can experience hypermagnesemia from food sources which can lead to serious cardiac and neurological symptoms.
2
Nonfood magnesium, such as supplements used for pharmacological purposes, can be associated with negative effects. Excessive magnesium consumption from non-food sources often lead to diarrhea.
2
Less common and more serious effects of excess magnesium include: respiratory paralysis, coma, mineral deficiencies, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and death.
2
Deficiency
Magnesium deficiency as the result of inadequate intake is rare in healthy individuals due to the homeostatic function of the kidney which can prevent the excretion of magnesium in the urine.
2
Certain medications (such as diuretics, steroids, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapy drugs), medical conditions (such as diabetes, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and pancreatitis), alcoholism, and chronically inadequate magnesium intake can lead to deficiencies.
4
A magnesium deficiency can result in a variety of symptoms which can include: sleep disorders, agitation, irritability, vomiting, anxiety, hyperventilation, confusion, restless leg syndrome, insomnia, nausea, low blood pressure, arrhythmia, weakness, muscle spasms, and seizures. Serious magnesium deficiency can result in hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.

11.1 Iron
[
]
Iron is one of the most essential minerals in the body. It helps to keep oxygen circulating throughout the body and also aids in bodily transport of certain essential chemicals. Iron is in every cell in your body and is an important component in hemoglobin – a protein molecule in erythrocytes that carries oxygen throughout the body. If your body has an iron deficiency, it lacks the resources to make healthy oxygen-carrying erythrocytes. Without healthy oxygen-carrying erythrocytes, the body cannot get enough oxygen to the rest of the body, which can cause the body to become tired and fatigued. Iron is also an important part of maintaining skin, hair and nail function.
If you have ever tried to give blood and could not because of your hemoglobin levels were too low, they often tell you to go eat iron-rich foods. Iron can enter the body through iron-rich foods like red meat, spinach and other dark, leafy green vegetables. Some people have such low iron that they take an iron supplement. These over-the-counter supplements are very common.
When iron levels are particularly low and cannot produce enough hemoglobin, a doctor may diagnose you with iron deficiency anemia. Some symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include extreme fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath, increased risk of infections and headaches. There are a few different causes of this disorder; blood loss can be a major reason for iron deficiency anemia. When you lose a good amount of blood you will also lose a good amount of iron. Your body needs an extra source of iron, like a supplement, in order to rapidly make more erythrocytes and hemoglobin. Another very common reason for iron deficiency anemia is simply a lack of iron in a daily diet. This is probably the most common reason for iron deficiency anemia, and also the most easily treatable. Ways to get more iron in a daily diet include eating more iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, dark leafy green vegetables and eggs. Women who are pregnant have an increase risk of iron deficiency anemia because their body is using twice the amount of iron for themselves as well as for the fetus. Pregnant women can take an over-the-counter iron supplement to combat this issue. Women on their period have an increase risk of iron deficiency anemia because of blood loss. Vegetarians also have an increased iron deficiency anemia because they do not have a very iron-rich diet without red meat and poultry. (Updated by Murphy, E)
11.1.1 Sources
[
]
Iron can be found in a wide range of food sources. There are two types of dietary iron sources, heme iron and nonheme iron. Heme iron is derived from hemoglobin, which makes up 40% of iron found in animal sources.
Heme iron is well absorbed.  Examples of adequate animal source foods are red meats, fish, poultry, shellfish, and eggs. Liver, oysters, chickpeas, pumpkin seeds, soybeans and fortified cereals are especially bulky sources of dietary iron. Nonheme iron is derived from plant sources, making up 60% of iron found in plants and some animal tissues, such as in legumes, lentils, beans, spinach and dried fruits.
Our bodies less efficiently absorb nonheme iron but it makes up the majority of our dietary iron. George Mateljan says that plant source foods contain more than 10% of our daily iron requirement per serving.
This can be explained by the fact that plant source foods have fewer calories per serving and therefore have a higher density of nutrients per calorie. To assist our bodies in absorption of iron it is beneficial to eat an iron source along with a source of vitamin C. Adding 50 milligrams or more of vitamin to an iron-rich meal will make it possible to triple the absorption of dietary iron.
According to nutritionist, vitamin C has a stronger affect on nonheme iron than it does on heme iron. Many vegetables such as broccoli are high in both iron and vitamin C, thus allowing a hefty amount of iron to be absorbed. Certain foods and beverages can decrease iron absorption, for example tea and coffee.
Iron Absorption
Iron absorption is used to preserve Iron in the body so that the amount of iron excreted is matching the daily intake of iron. This regulation of iron is important because it could lead to anemia and various other iron deficiencies. Iron absorption takes place in the small intestine; particularly the duodenum and jejunum of the small intestine.1 However, only about 10% of iron in the duodenum becomes absorbed.1
There are a copious amount of factors that influence iron absorption. One factor that influences iron absorption are inhibitors. During absorption, gastric acid is released that lowers the pH inside the stomach to increase the solubility of iron to be absorbed into the enterocytes.1 However, inhibitors cause this gastric acid lowering to be impaired and prevent iron from being absorbed the way that it should. These inhibitors include dairy products, coffee, tea, oregano, soy, and cereals.2 Another factor affecting the absorption of iron are other metals competing for absorption. Iron is absorbed by use of a receptor called DMT-1, and these metal ions compete to attach to this receptor. These metal ions include lead, cobalt, strontium, manganese, and Zinc.1 Facilitators also affect iron absorption and these include iron deficiencies, amino acids, citrate, and ascorbate. Finally iron absorption is affected based on whether the iron is heme (easily absorbed in blood and comes from meat), or non-heme (Fe2+ and Fe3+).3
There are two types of iron that play a role in the absorption process: Heme iron, which is easily absorbed into the blood, and non-heme iron, which is absorbed by a more difficult process.3 The physical state of iron also plays a role in the absorption process. There is ferrous (FE2+) and there is ferric (Fe3+) iron. Ferrous iron is oxidized into the insoluble form of ferric iron by Vitamin C and gastric acid lowers the pH so that the iron is able to be taken up more easily into the cell.1
This absorption process of non-heme iron begins by active transport of iron into a cell (use of ATP) by a transporter cell called DMT-1 or the divalent mental transporter-1. This transporter actively moves the iron into the cell and is situated on the surface of the duodenum in enterocytes.4 This receptor is not iron specific and also transports various other metal ions into cells. Once the iron is absorbed by the transporter and is inside the enterocyte, it can either bind to ferroportin which is a transporter, or it can bind to ferritin which is an intracellular binding protein of iron.4 Iron that binds to ferritin tends to remain there because ferritin is a major storage site for iron as well. Whereas, Iron that binds to ferroportion is transported into the blood and binds to transferrin (iron binding protein of the blood), where iron is then transported to red blood cell precursors.4
Two signals also play a significant role in the absorption of iron into the enterocyte. The first is a hormone called erythropoietin, which is formed in the kidneys, stimulates red blood cell production, and promotes another signal to increase iron absorption. The second signal, hepcidin, is produced when iron stores are full. Hepcidin is produced by hepatocytes and regulates the amount of iron flowing into the blood in order to prevent an over or under amount of iron in the blood.4 The normal range of iron in the blood is about 20-45%. If iron in the blood is above the normal range it could potentially cause Hemochromatosis which will cause damage to cells and promote free radical formation that affect tissues in our body.4

11.1.2 Functions
[
]
Iron is an essential nutrient because it is required to make hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are oxygen-carrying proteins in the body’s blood cells.
Hemoglobin is located in red blood cells, while myoglobin is located in muscles. About 70% of the bodies iron is found in hemoglobin and myoglobin.
Hemoglobin assist in the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to tissues located throughout the body. Iron is what creates the red color to our blood. Myoglobin receives, supplies, carries, and releases oxygen to our body muscles and the heart. Another function of iron is to make other body proteins, such as proteins essential for respiration and energy metabolism. Iron is also a component of enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of DNA, collagen, and certain neurotransmitters. Finally, iron contributes to proper immune function.
This function of iron is most important during childhood and pregnancy.
11.1.3 Requirements
[
]
Iron, unlike many other minerals is not actively excreted from the body through the intestines and urine. The body looses iron with the loss of cells from the interior and exterior portions of the body, as well as through blood loss. The expected amount of iron lost from the body can be calculated by dividing 14 µg by body weight in kilograms divided by the number of days. It is estimated that there is approximately a 15% variation among each individual’s iron loss (Chapter 13. Iron).
Iron requirements vary greatly depending on the sex and stage of life of the person in question. Starting in infancy iron is very important for growth. When a baby is born it has approximately 250–300 mg of iron in its body. This higher concentration of iron is due to the limited amount of oxygen that was available to the infant prior to its birth. As a baby ages to approximately 6 months old, iron is redistributed to iron stores and the child needs to consume very little iron to stay healthy. Between 4 and 6 months of age the baby’s iron requirements will rise significantly to between 0.7 and 0.9 mg per day, and will remain this high throughout the first year of life. In infants born prematurely or underweight extra iron may be necessary to improve or continue health due to the fact that the high increase in iron during the gestational period primarily occurs in the last trimester. A child’s iron stores will double within the first year and then double again between the ages of 1 and 6. After the age of 6 iron requirements will begin to normalize only to spike again during puberty and rapid growth. Another group with higher iron requirements is pre-menopausal women. Large, consistent, amounts of iron are lost during menstruation, however the amount of iron needed to replenish the iron stores is highly variable among each woman. After the occurrence of menopause a woman’s iron requirements are the same as the requirement for men (Chapter 13. Iron).
The following is the recommended amount of dietary intake by stage of life and gender. It is important to note that the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vegetarians and others who adhere to no meat diets is 1.8 times higher than the normal recommendation. This is because the heme iron found in meats is both more bioavailable and increases the bioavailability of the nonheme iron found in plant-based foods (Iron, 2015).

11.1.4 Deficiency
[
]
Anemia is a common ailment characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells. It also occurs when red blood cells in your body lack hemoglobin, a protein that enables the cells to carry sufficient oxygen to the tissues of the body (“What is Anemia,” 2012). Although the leading cause of anemia is blood loss, there are multiple types of anemia with various causes. This blood condition can be short term or long term and ranges from mild to severe (“Anemia,” 2014).
Common causes of anemia are loss of blood, as mentioned before, low red blood cell production, and high amounts of red blood cells being destroyed. Loss of blood can be caused by heavy menstrual cycles, bleeding in digestive or urinary tracts, surgery, traumas, and even cancer. Furthermore, low red blood cell production can be the result of various factors. These factors include a diet with inadequate iron, low levels of the erythropoietin hormone, and certain chronic diseases, such as kidney disease. Finally, high rates of red blood cell destruction develop due to an enlarged or unhealthy spleen. Certain genetic characteristics may also cause your body to destroy an excessive amount of red blood cells like in the case of sickle cell anemia (“What is Anemia,” 2012).
Certain individuals are at more risk of developing anemia than others. Some of these risk factors can be altered or changed, whereas others cannot. An example of a risk factor that can be altered is an iron-deficient diet. By increasing one’s intake of iron, the risk of developing anemia can be reduced. Risk factors that cannot be changed include blood loss from a surgery or trauma, pregnancy, and inherited anemia (“What is Anemia,” 2012). Various symptoms accompany anemia, the most common symptom being fatigue. Other symptoms of anemia include headaches, dizziness, cognitive complications, and shortness of breath. These symptoms may result due to the increased amount of work your heart is exerting in order to pump oxygen enriched blood throughout your body. Sometimes less severe forms of anemia may have mild or no symptoms (“Anemia,” 2014).
The primary goal when treating anemia is to increase the red blood cell count in the body so that the blood can carry a much larger amount of oxygen (“What is Anemia,” 2012). Iron fortification or the defense of iron levels in the body is the primary way of both treating and preventing anemia. Individuals, especially pregnant and menstruating women must make the effort to increase their iron intake whether through use of supplements or changes in diet (Miller, 2013, p. 8). Furthermore, medicines, surgeries, and procedures like blood transfusions and bone marrow transplants are alternate ways to treat anemia, particularly severe forms of anemia (“What is Anemia,” 2012).

11.1.5 Toxicity
[
]
Iron Toxicity, otherwise known as iron overload, occurs when the body cannot prevent excess iron from being absorbed. Normally, when the required dosage of iron is satisfied, and all iron stores in the body are full, the absorption of iron comes to a halt and excess iron is excreted. In certain metabolic, genetic disorders, the body can not adequately control the absorption of iron, and continues to absorb iron even though all iron stores are filled and the body's required iron dosage is satisfied. This disorder is known as hemochromatosis, and is normally caused by the deficiency of the hormone hepcidin (Brissot, 2010). Hepcidin is responsible for maintaining iron homeostasis and regulating iron metabolism (Rossi, 2005). Furthermore, hepcidin is synthesized by the liver, and consist of 25 amino acid peptides (Rossi, 2005). Moreover, when hepcidin is not being produced sufficiently by the liver, excess iron begins to accumulate in or around the body's organs such as the heart, liver, and joints. This excess iron can cause a multitude of problematic health effects, including increasing the damage by free radicals, which have been linked to certain kinds of cancer (Ramm, 2010). Concerning iron toxicity, some symptoms include lethargy, fatigue, and apathy. The symptoms of iron toxicity are also extremely similar to those of anemia, which is why individuals should exhibit caution when dealing with iron supplements. An individual may believe they have iron defiance anemia when in fact they could be suffering from iron toxicity. This confusion might cause the individual to consume iron supplements, which can be extremely dangerous if the body already has toxic levels of iron. Regarding iron supplements, another form of iron toxicity can be achieved by overdosing on iron, which is normally caused by taking excessive iron supplements. Children are especially vulnerable to this form of iron toxicity, since they have smaller livers and in fact iron overdose is one of the leading causes of death in children ("Medscape", 2010). Having these high levels of iron in the blood, also help fuel infections because bacteria and viruses are known to flourish in the iron rich blood (Zheng, 2012) . More symptoms involved with iron overdose include damage to the gastrointestinal tract, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis and abdominal pain ("Medscape", 2010). Iron toxicity is also developed with excess blood transfusions, because the iron is directly transferred into the blood stream and does not manage to go through the small intestine where it can removed if necessary (Fleming, 2012). Iron toxicity can be potentially deadly, and treatment involves donating blood, which helps remove blood from the body, thereby reducing the amount of iron, and introducing a chelate into the bloodstream, which bonds with iron, and helps the body in its excretion (Fleming, 2012).

11.2 Zinc
[
]
Zinc is a trace mineral essential for the health of the human body. It has several roles in metabolism and immune function and it is needed to produce retinal, the active form of vitamin A. It is also a key factor in the growth and development of children and it affects behavior and perception of taste. In the U.S., it is recommended that men over 19 years of age consume 11 milligrams per day, and 8 milligrams per day for women (“Zinc Fact”). The upper limit is set to 40 milligrams. If an adult consumes more than 40 milligrams of zinc per day, it can lead to a copper deficiency, which can, in turn, lead to the degeneration of the heart muscle (Whitney& Rolfes, 2013).

11.2.1 Sources
[
]
The best sources of zinc are plain yogurt, ground beef, oysters, broccoli, lean sirloin steak, and crab. These foods provide the best sources per kilocalorie. Foods rich in protein have the highest amount of zinc. A few other sources include peanuts, sunflower seeds, and pinto beans. When eaten in large quantities, whole grains and legumes can be great sources of zinc. It is important to note that phytates inhibit the absorption of dietary zinc. Phytates are found in whole grain breads, legumes, cereals, and other grains. These plant and grain-based foods are still good sources of zinc, but the zinc in these foods is not as bioavailable compared to that of animal foods (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).

Zinc and its Functions
Zinc is an essential trace mineral. Zinc is found in seafood, red meat, beans, turkey, yogurt, bran most protein and fortified products. Zincs functions include cell reproduction, cell growth, metabolism, immune function and many more.This trace mineral is proven its most important during childhood and pregnancy due to its contribution to the growth and development of the human body. Zin also assists in common functions such as sight and smell. However,  Zinc has three main functions which include supporting the immune system, metabolism and cell replication. Without Zinc,  your body will suffer much turmoil.
Immune System
Research shows that if consumed regularly, Zinc can reduce the chance of one getting the common cold. Zinc Deficiency foremost impacts the human immune system. It works towards three factors within the immune system. Zinc fights away pathogens, immune cell function and is a messenger in transduction. (Haase and Rink, 2014) Just a single dietary supplement, when experiencing the common cold will reduce the long lasting symptoms and decreases the severity of those symptoms. (Sarubin Fragaakis A, 2007) Lack of Zinc can lead to more infections, acne, and more illnesses.
Metabolism and Zinc
Zinc plays a huge role in metabolism. It assists in bone metabolism which is why it is such a great contributor to bone development. People who suffer from zinc deficiency also suffer from growth defects or osteoporosis because their bones are not getting ample support nor development. Zinc also modifies the metabolism of cGMP and transcription factor MTF-1 which all together assists in gene transcription and development of protein kinase C.  Zinc also assist in the metabolism of Vitamin A. This fat soluble vitamins functions are storage and use of insulin, vision, growth, reproduction and healthy skin.
Cell Proliferation
Zinc is vital in cell proliferation, which means that it assist in cell growth and division. This includes the synthesis of DNA and mitosis. It assists in the transcription of proteins and enzymes. Zinc is essentially on the building blocks for cells and protein of the human body. (Beyersmann and Haase, 2001) This is important because proteins are what build bones, skin, muscles and blood, all of which pertain to and are essential to the human body. Zinc Fingers are also essential in the process of cell proliferation, one percent of DNA is found in these structures. ZInc Fingers are essentially finger like protrusions that assist in transcription factors. .
Zinc Deficiency
Zinc clearly contributes a lot to our well being. If not consumed to the necessary amount it can cause a Zinc deficiency. This could entail possible deficiencies such as sickle cell anemia, dwarfism, night blindness and even mental health problems. Symptoms include hair loss, loss of appetite, impaired taste buds and low hormone synthesis.

The main symptoms of zinc deficiency include growth retardation, impaired immune function, and loss of appetite. Children have the highest need for zinc because they are undergoing rapid growth. Children in developing countries often suffer from a zinc deficiency and will have stunted growth. In addition, because zinc is required to produce the active form of vitamin A, vision impairments have been linked to zinc deficiency. Adults should not consume more than 40 milligrams of zinc per day (“Zinc”). High doses of zinc is characterized by vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, and exhaustion (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). Supplementation of any mineral can lead to imbalances, but zinc supplements have proven very useful for certain circumstances, especially in developing countries. The supplements contribute to a decrease in the prevalence of disease, as well as death, related to diarrhea in children. Also, zinc supplements in the form of lozenges have been used to treat the common cold. Some studies have had conflicting results, but it is accepted that zinc is a beneficial temporary fix for a sore throat (“Zinc Fact”).

11.3 Iodine
[
]
Iodine is an essential non-metallic mineral that can be found naturally, in trace amounts, within the body as well as several common foods such as kelp, shellfish, and probiotic yogurt. Upon consumption of foods containing iodine the digestive system breaks down these foods via gastrointestinal tract and iodine is readily absorbed into the body. Within the body iodine becomes the iodide ion (I-1) and bonds to a myriad of different organic compounds. Although the amount of iodide that can be found throughout the body is dwarfed by the amount of major minerals that can be found, it is still responsible for several major and minor roles within the body. In the body, approximately 70-80% of iodine is found in the thyroid gland while the other 20-30% is found primarily in the muscles, blood, and ovaries in women (University of Maryland Medical Center [UMMC], 2013). Iodide is required for thyroid hormone production, which is necessary for normal growth and development (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011). Iodine is important for everyone, but it is especially important for infants and pregnant women. Iodine deficiency can be detrimental to the health and growth of children and could lead to several complications both physically and mentally. In fact, Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of preventable mental impairment (UA 2015). Iodine deficiency is not a major problem in most prominent countries, due to farming techniques that promote iodine rich soils and popular usage of iodized salt. However, in several underdeveloped countries both women and children alike face the complications of iodine deficiency due to lack of access of iodine rich foods. Typically iodine can more easily be found in countries that have easy access to the ocean or countries that have settlements that have once been undersea. Therefore dryer and more inland countries such Ethiopia, Senegal and several others face the consistent problem of iodine deficiency (UA, 2015). Availability of iodine becomes scarce in countries with large and concentrated population as well, despite methods to combat iodine deifiency (AIIMS 2015).
11.3.1 Sources

Iodine is predominantly found in seafood and areas where the soil is rich in iodine such as coastal areas and land that was once under the ocean. Shellfish, white fish, seaweed, and plants grown in iodine-rich soil are excellent nutritional sources of iodine. Several countries are using iodized salt in place of standard cooking salts. These iodized salts can be used in several different meals to provide a sufficient amount of iodine in locations distant from the ocean. The use of iodized salts is highly popular, though it is recommended to get iodine from different sources as well. It is important to note that processed foods such as canned soups, which are especially common in American diets, do contain salt but it is almost never iodized salt (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [HHS], 2011). Additional sources of iodine include bakery products, milk, and iodized salt- all of which are most common in developed countries (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011). Iodates or iodine salts are used as stabilizing agents in dough, which makes bakery products a source of iodine (UMMC, 2013). Dairies give medications including iodine to their livestock and use iodine to decontaminate equipment used for milking so products such as milk, yogurt, and butter are additional dietary sources for iodine consumption (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011). A method to disinfect drinking water with iodinated disinfection byproducts is being developed and gaining interest as well, and possibly a new source of iodine in one’s diet (SKLPCRR, 2015). Currently chloroamination of water is being more popularly used, however the demand for clean water and specifically iodine in certain countries could skew what the majority disinfection method is.
11.3.2 Functions
[

Iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function because it is a major component of the thyroid hormones known as T3 (triiodothryonine) and T4 (thyroxine). These two hormones are very significant in the body because they play a role in regulating the basal metabolic rate and body temperature. Additionally, these hormones are important for promoting growth, development, metabolism, and reproductive function. The thyroid hormones are also important for blood cell production and nerve and muscle function (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011). Iodine is also important in the health of mammary tissue (Ahad & Ganie, 2010 (Links to an external site). However, the thyroid gland needs no more than 70 micrograms per day to synthesize the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3. The higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function of a number of other body systems, including lactating breasts, gastric mucosa, salivary glands, oral mucosa, arterial walls,
thymus
, epidermis,
choroid plexus
and
cerebrospinal fluid
, among others.
Sequence of 123-iodide human scintiscans after an intravenous injection, (from left) after 30 minutes, 20 hours, and 48 hours. A high and rapid concentration of radio-iodide is evident in cerebrospinal fluid (left), gastric and oral mucosa, salivary glands, arterial walls, ovary and thymus. In the thyroid gland, I-concentration is more progressive, as in a reservoir (from 1% after 30 minutes, and after 6, 20 h, to 5.8% after 48 hours, of the total injected dose).(Venturi, 2000)
11.3.3 Requirements
[
]
The amount of iodine required each day depends on age. Below is a table that shows average daily-recommended amounts (HHS, 2011).
Life Stage	(Recommended Amount)
Birth to 6 months	(110 mcg)
Infants 7–12 months	(130 mcg)
Children 1–8 years	 (90 mcg)
Children 9–13 years	(120 mcg)
Teens 14–18 years	(150 mcg)
Adults	(150 mcg)
Pregnant teens and women	(220 mcg)
Breastfeeding teens and women	(290 mcg)
There are also restrictions regarding the maximum amount of iodine that should be consumed each day. These are known as Tolerable Uptake Intake Levels (UL) and they are the highest levels of iodine that can be consumed without causing side effects. These levels are documented below (UMMC, 2013).
Life Stage	(Tolerable Uptake Intake Level (UL))
Children 1–3 years	(200 mcg)
Children 4–8 years	(300 mcg)
Children 9–13 years	(600 mcg)
Teens 14–18 years (including pregnant & breastfeeding)	(900 mcg)
Adults 19 years and up (including pregnant & breastfeeding)	(1100 mcg)
11.3.4 Imbalance

Iodine deficiency is an important health problem throughout much of the world, especially in underdeveloped countries and mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, Andes, and European Alps. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in river valley areas due to leaching of the iodine from the soil (Caballero, 2009). Iodine imbalance or deficiency is less common in developed countries such as the United States and Canada due to the iodization of salt. However, in parts of the world where iodine and iodized salt are not easily available, conditions known as goiter or cretinism can occur.
Goiter is one of the earliest signs of iodine deficiency. Goiter affects about 200 million people in the world and most cases are found in South America, Asia, and Africa. A goiter is a visible lump in the neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland. The thyroid becomes enlarged due to the cells of the thyroid gland becoming enlarged in order to trap as much iodide as possible (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011). As the thyroid begins to enlarge, the pituitary gland begins secreting more TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) in order to help the thyroid take in more iodide (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). A goiter is described as being grade 1 if it can be felt but not seen when the neck is extended and it is described as being grade 2 if it can be seen when the neck is in a normal position (Institute of Medicine, 2001).
Cretinism is the mental and physical retardation of a person that is caused by iodine deficiency during pregnancy. This condition affects about six million people worldwide. Cretinism is irreversible, but can be prevented by the early identification and treatment of maternal iodine deficiency (Whitney & Rolfes, 2011).  The World Health Organization recognizes iodine deficiency as the most common avoidable cause of brain damage today (Caballero, 2009).
An iodine deficiency also interferes with the synthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 because a major component of T3 and T4 is iodine. When there is a lack of iodine, there is an increased amount of TSH but a decreased amount of the two thyroid hormones – creating a greater imbalance in the body (Ahad & Ganie, 2010).
An overdose of iodine is not that common in the United States, as most foods that contain iodine do not contain enough to cause an individual to ingest an excess amount. Adults are advised not to ingest more than 1.1 mg/day, which is well above any recommended levels, to avoid an iodine overdose (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Symptoms of acute iodine poisoning are abdominal pain, shortness of breath, delirium, lack of urine, vomiting, and diarrhea (NLM, 2015). Even though goiters are associated with an iodine deficiency, an overdose of iodine can cause the thyroid to enlarge due to the elevated amounts of TSH (Institute of Medicine, 2001).
Pregnant women have to be exceptionally careful with their iodine intake. Iodine induced goiters have been found in newborns when the mother had an excess of iodine during pregnancy (Institute of Medicine, 2001 (Links to an external site.)). The iodine induced goiter in the fetus can suffocate and potentially kill the fetus (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). If the mother has hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, the fetus is at risk of many complications such as growth retardation and a premature birth (Medscape, 1997). Studies have shown that children are more likely to have a lower IQ if their mother had high levels of TSH 16 weeks into the pregnancy (Zoeller, 2003).
There is also a correlation between breast cancer and an imbalance of iodine. However, there is not enough evidence to prove that either excess or a deficiency of iodine causes breast cancer (Smyth, 2003). Iodine has been found to be important in mammary tissue. An adequate amount of iodine in the mammary tissue helps prevent damage to the breast tissue while a deficiency of iodine in the mammary tissue is linked to damage of the breast tissue due to an accumulation of malondialdehyde (Ahad & Ganie, 2010 (Links to an external site.)).

Selenium can be found in animal based foods, plant based foods and in a dietary supplement.  For animal based foods, a good source of selenium is found in organ meats, such as the liver, and seafood (Sunde). Selenium can also be found in plant based food such as nuts and grains. The highest source of selenium is found in Brazil Nuts. Brazil Nuts contains about 544 mcg of selenium per serving (Thomson et al., 2008). This amounts to over 700% of the daily value established by the FDA. A poor source of selenium containing foods are found in vegetables, fruit and diary (Tinggi et., 1992).
The concentration of selenium found in plant based food is effected by several environmental factors. The pH and selenium concentration of the soil influence the selenium concentration in food (Rayman, 2008). Thus the amount of selenium found in food is a variable of geographical location. In areas that are low in selenium concentrations, farmers will add selenium into their fertilizer or livestock feed to increase selenium concentration.
There are different chemical forms of selenium found in food. The chemical forms are characterized as organic or inorganic compounds. The organic and most abundant forms found in food are selenocysteine and selenomethionine (“7 Selenium”). Selennocysteine is found in animal selenoproteins. Selenomethionine is found inside the muscle tissue of animals. However it is initially synthesized inside plants. Humans are incapable of producing selenomethionine, it must be consumed from food. About 90 percent or more of Selenomethionine is absorbed into the body (Swanson et al., 1991). This form of selenium is predominantly found in animal and plant based products.   The two major inorganic forms are selenites and selenates. Selenates (SeO42-) has a high absorption rate. Almost all of it is absorbed into the body, however a significant amount is loss and excreted with urine. On the other hand, Selenites ( SeO32-) does not have as high of an absorption rate as selenates, but it does have a higher retention rate (Thomson and Robinson, 1986).  In contrast to selenomethionine, only about 50% of selenites is absorbed by the body. (Thomson and Robinson, 1986). Selenites and selenates are traditionally found in animal feeds and dietary supplements.
All three major forms of selenium, selenomethionine, selenates and selenites are found in dietary supplements.

11.4.2 Functions
[
]
Selenium, a micronutrient, plays a vital role within the enzymatic function of the human body and is linked to aiding in the stimulation of antibody production (which are disease-fighting organisms within the human body) following a vaccination ("Selenium.", n.d.). Selenium is also linked to aiding in male fertility and is also considered an antioxidant (Mangiapane, 2014). Selenium may work alongside other antioxidants (like vitamin C and E) in order to protect the cells of the body against reactive oxygen species or “free radicals”, which are linked to the development of various cancers and heart disease ("Selenium.", n.d.). Selenium protects against these free radicals by aiding to prevent the formation of these highly unstable and volatile molecules ("Selenium.", n.d.).
Selenium has a wide range of varying functions, which are mainly due in large part to the amino acid Selenocysteine. This amino acid is found in twenty-five proteins (also known as Selenoproteins) (Kurokawa, n.d.). Within the human genome, there are twenty-five identified genes that code for Selenoproteins (Kurokawa, n.d.). Of these twenty-five, the following have known functions:
5 Glutathione Peroxidases
3 Thioredoxin Reductases
3 Iodothyronine Deiodinases
1 Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase B1
The twelve above are among the most well known Selenoproteins, along with their main functions which have been identified within various research publications.
Various research publications have gradually begun to uncover all of the potential metabolic functions of all of the present and identified human selenoproteins (Olson, 2008). The Selenoproteins with identified functions include the following:
Glutathione peroxidases
Thioredoxin reductases
Iodothyronine deiodinases (thyroid hormone deiodinases)
Selenoprotein P
Selenoprotein W
Selenophosphate synthetase 2
Methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (formerly selenoprotein R)
15 kDa selenoprotein
Selenoprotein S
Glutathione peroxidases have five different identified selenium-containing  types:
GPx1- which is a cytosolic GPx
GPx2- which is a epithelial cell-specific GPx expressed in intestinal lining and lungs
GPx3- which is highly expressed in thyroid gland and kidneys
GPx4- which is a phospholipid-hydroperoxide GPx or PHGPx
GPx6- which is expressed in the epithelium of the olfactory
GPx isoenzymes are all antioxidant enzymes, that are linked with the reduction of all potentially damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the oxidation-reduction coupling using glutathione. Selenoprotein P aids in spermatogenesis and male fertility using GPx4 (Boitani, n.d.). In the testes, GPx4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides, which in turn protects the immature spermatozoa cells against oxidative stress (Boitani, n.d.).
Thioredoxin reductases have three identified Selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) isoenzymes (Arner, 2009):
TrxR- which is in the cytosol
TrxR3- which is in the mitochondria
Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (or TGR)- which is testes-specific
Iodothyronine deiodinases have three identified selenium-dependent iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO) isoenzymes:
Selenium-dependent Iodothyronine Deiodinases (DIO type 1)
Selenium-dependent Iodothyronine Deiodinases (DIO type 2)
Selenium-dependent Iodothyronine Deiodinases (DIO type 3)
Iodothyronine deiodinases (thyroid hormone deiodinases) catalyze the removal of an atom of from T4 (inactive form of thyroid hormone, or T3 precursor) in order to generate majority of the biologically active T3 within the human circulation and on the inside of cells (Schomburg, 2012).
Selenoprotein has three identified selenium-dependent isoenzymes (Olson, 2008):
Selenoprotein P (SEPP1)
Selenoprotein W (SEPW or SelW)
Selenoprotein S (SEPS1 or SelS)
Selenoprotein P (or SEPP1) is predominately produced by the liver, and works as an antioxidant to protect cells from oxidative damage or stress. SEPP1 enables the full activity of thioredoxin reductases and glutathione peroxidases by providing an adequate supply of selenium to all of the other extrahepatic tissues (Arner, 2009). Selenoprotein W (SEPW or SelW) plays a role in redox regulation specifically in the brain, providing protection against oxidative stress which could induce neuronal cell death (Olson, 2008). Selenoprotein S (SEPS1 or SelS) is involved in the cell’s response to ER stress, which is triggered by the presence of misfolded proteins (Olson, 2008). SEPS1 contributes to the removal and transfer of these misfolded proteins from within the lumen of the ER to the cytosol. This is where proteins are then tagged with ubiquitin in order to be degraded later on (Olson, 2008). Selenophosphate synthetase 2 is a selenium donor that catalyzes the synthesis of selenophosphate using hydrogen selenide.
Methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (previously known as Selenoprotein R) has three identified selenium-dependent isoenzymes:
Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrA)
Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrB1, 2, or 3)
MsrB1 is linked to the regulation of redox reactions of certain proteins, particularly in macrophages, where chemotaxis and phagocytosis rely heavily on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to occur. Therefore, this regulation requires a MsrB1-dependent reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide residues within the actin.
15 kDa selenoprotein (Selenoprotein 15 or SEP15) is highly expressed in various organs such as the prostate, kidney, testes, liver, and brain (Hill, 2012). Although the function of this Selenoprotein is unknown, SEP15 possess a thioredoxin-like catalytic site and therefore it is presumed that it either regulates the activity of UGGT or the redox state of the UGGT substrates (Hill, 2012). This aspect is said to be critical to this Selenoprotein’s quality control system in regard to the protein folding in the lens of the eye, as well as why it is implicated in various anti-cancer mechanisms (Hill, 2012).

11.4.3 Requirements
[
]
Selenium deficiency can lead to a heart disease called Keshan disease (Whitney, 2013). This disease is prevalent in China where the soil lacks selenium. Side effects of selenium deficiency include poor immunity and impaired cognation.  Selenium deficiency also causes male infertility, could exacerbate iodine deficiencies and is potentially associated with Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck disease is a type of osteoarthritis. Adequate amounts of selenium are important because it is an antioxidant nutrient. This means having an adequate intake of selenium may help prevent cancer. The recommended daily allowance is 55 micrograms per day. The side effects associated with the toxicity of selenium include brittleness of hair and nails, garlic breath odor, and nervous system abnormalities. These side effects cause selenium to have an UL of 400 micrograms per day. Pregnant and lactating females are recommended an extra 60 or 70 micrograms of selenium per day. Also, the older a human gets, the more selenium they should consume.

11.4.4 Imbalance
[
]
Selenium Toxicity
	High doses of the trace mineral Selenium is quite toxic so the recommended maximum daily intake of Selenium for adults is 0.0004 grams a day.  A high intake of Selenium at one time can result in acute or fatal toxicities and small doses of Selenium over long periods of time can result in chronic selenium toxicity, also known as selenosis.  Selenosis is noticeable from hair and nails becoming brittle or breaking away, a garlic like odor on breath, or in some severe cases, nervous system abnormalities.  Other possible symptoms of Selenium toxicity may include skin rashes, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, and irritability.
Selenium Deficiency
Impaired cognition, susceptibility to psychological stress, and a poor immune system are symptoms of Selenium deficiency.  Several selenium responsive enzymes such as iodothyronine deiodinases, selenoprotein W, glutathione peroxidases may be negatively affected with an insufficient selenium intake.  Bariatric surgery or severe gastrointestinal conditions like that of Crohn’s disease can increase the risk of acquiring a selenium deficiency.  The heart disease known as the Keshan disease is also tied to prolonged Selenium deficiency, though it is believed that Keshan is primarily caused by a virus or a toxin.  Keshan is a fatal form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is found most rampant in places like China where there is not a sufficient amount of Selenium found in the food or soil.  An enlargement of the heart which causes it to work insufficiently is a key factor in the chronic form of the Keshan disease along with the middle layer of muscle tissue in the wall of the heart being replaced by fibrous tissue while the acute form of the Keshan disease is observed to contain sudden onsets of cardiac insufficiency.   Even still, an adequate amount of Selenium helps in preventing Keshan while not obtaining enough Selenium will actually increase the likelihood of contracting Keshan.  Now selenium supplements such as sodium selenite has the ability to prevent people from developing the Keshan disease, but it is unable to reverse any of the damage done to the heart muscles.  Another disease that also affects low selenium communities like North Korea and central China is the Kashin-Beck disease.  The Kashin-Beck disease results in the degeneration of articular cartilage between joints that may lead to joint deformities.  Some of the most severe forms of the disease have led to dwarfism.  Children as young as two years old have been known to be affected by the Keshan-Beck disease.

Selenium toxicity or deficiency are uncommon here in the United States. Since foods such as whole wheat bread, chicken, tuna, brown rice, oatmeal, and mushrooms are all high in selenium, Americans often consume more than enough selenium in their diet (“Top 10 Foods Highest in Selenium”). Since selenium is a trace mineral, only small amounts of it are required in a person’s diet, with the recommended dietary allowance for both men and women being 55 micrograms a day. There is also a “Tolerable Upper Level Intake Level” of 400 micrograms a day to avoid selenium toxicity (“7 Selenium”)
Selenium deficiency is rare in the United States due to it being found in a majority of foods in our diet and because farmers also add selenium to the fertilizer they use and to livestock feed. A deficiency in selenium can be common if someone is following a vegetarian diet, since most vegetables are a poor source of selenium if it is not added to the soil. Also people who are undergoing kidney dialysis very often also have low levels of selenium because during this process some selenium is removed from the blood. People living with HIV have low levels of selenium possibly due to malabsorption. It can also be related to a poor diet in developing countries (“Selenium”). People fed intravenously for long periods of time may also suffer from selenium deficiency (“Selenium in Diet”)”). Selenium deficiency could eventually lead to Keshan’s disease, a cardiomyopathy disease that was first noted in Keshan County in Northeast China before a government sponsored selenium supplementation program was created in 1970 (“Keshan’s Disease”). This has been the only confirmed disease linked to a deficiency in selenium, but it has also been associated with male infertility and Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck is a joint and bone disease (“Selenium in diet”).

Selenium toxicity could cause selenosis that included symptoms such as skin rash, fingernail loss, fatigue, weight loss, irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin lesions. People suffering from selenosis will also notice a strange garlic odor in their breath. This disease could potentially also cause nerve damage (“Chandler”). Selenium toxicity can be caused by eating too many foods that are high in selenium, such as Brazilian nuts that have 1917 micrograms of selenium per 100 grams of nuts (“Top 10 Foods Highest in Selenium”). It could also be caused by overusing dietary supplements or by dietary supplements that are mislabeled. For example, a dietary supplement may say that they have just the adequate amount of selenium where instead it may have 300 times that amount (“Selenium”).

Manganese Trace
11.5 Copper
[
]
Copper is one of nine trace minerals, which are mainly utilized as part of enzymes and hormones that are required for metabolism.  This section will cover the sources of copper; the functions of copper within the body; the dietary requirements for copper; and copper imbalances in the body.
11.5.1 Sources
[
]
Copper can be found in many different foods, both animal and plant based.  The richest sources of copper include oysters, whole grains, legumes, potatoes, and nuts. Other sources of copper in food include black pepper, yeast, prunes, cocoa, and dark leafy vegetables (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015).
11.5.2 Functions
[
]
The main function of copper is as a catalyst for different biochemical reactions in the body.  Possibly it’s most important role is in hemoglobin synthesis.  Copper is cofactor in several enzymes that speed up the oxidation of iron.  It is this iron that forms red blood cells, which are necessary for transport of oxygen throughout the body (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015; Texas Heart Institute, 2015).  Other important role of copper include the production of collagen, elastin, melanin, and neurotransmitters (Texas Heart Institute, 2015) as well as natural defenses against damage caused by free radicals (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013).
11.5.3 Requirements
[
]
The EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) of copper for children, ages 1 to 18 years, varies between 260 μg/day to 685 μg/day, increasing with age.  The RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) is slightly higher, ranging from 340 μg/day to 890 μg/day.  The EAR for adults, ages 19 and older, is 700 μg/day.  The RDA is 900 μg/day.  These numbers are set, regardless of gender.  In pregnancy, women need a slightly higher copper intake, as a baby delivered at full term contains 13.7 mg of copper, which must be taken from the mother during pregnancy.  Lactating mothers also require a higher copper intake.  For both pregnant and lactating women, the EAR is 1,000 μg/day and the RDA is 1,300 μg/day (Institute of Medicine (US) Panel on Micronutrients, 2001).
11.5.4 Imbalance
[
]
Imbalance of copper can be seen in two different genetic diseases. First, Menkes syndrome is the name given to a copper deficiency. This deficiency is marked by bone abnormalities, seizures, weakness in limbs, and brittle, kinky hair (Dutchen, 2012).  It results from intestinal cells absorbing copper but not being able to release it back into circulation.  This very rare disease occurs before birth, as it is an inherited disorder.  Although it can be carried by females, only males can develop the disease.  While some treatment options exist, such as copper injections into the bloodstream or under the skin, prognosis is not good, with most males dying within the first few years of life.  The second genetic disease involving copper is Wilson’s disease.  Also known as Hepatolenticular degeneration, it is an autosomal disorder in which copper transport is hindered.  This hindrance results in a buildup of copper that is deposited in the brain, kidney, liver, and eyes.  These deposits can cause liver damage, scarring, kidney failure, and death in some cases (Dutchen, 2012; U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2014).  Some of the symptoms of Wilson’s disease include dementia, ataxia, abdominal distention, impaired speech, tremors, and jaundiced eyes or skin. In order to test for Wilson’s, patients may be given a slit-lamp eye examination to show eye movement as well as rust-colored rings around the iris.  These rings are a result of the copper deposits in the eye.  Other tests may include a urine copper test, abdominal MRI, or liver biopsy.  The goal of treatments is to reduce the copper in the body’s tissues.  There are many medications that may be used, but regardless of medication, the treatment must be lifelong (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2014).

11.6.1 Sources, Absorption, and Excretion
[
]
Manganese can be found in mostly plant- based food sources, including a variety of legumes, shiitake mushrooms, whole grains, green leafy vegetables, garlic, flax seeds, almonds, walnuts, and tea (Lixandru, 2014). However rich tea is in manganese, tea is also rich in tannins, which can have an inhibiting effect on manganese. Also, although animal products contain hardly any manganese, they increase the bioavailability of manganese, enhancing its absorption into the body. (Watts, 1990) Manganese can also be obtained by infants through breast milk (Oregon State University, 2015). These foods can be excellent sources of manganese, as long as the food is prepared without the use of prolonged cooking methods, which have the potential to destroy manganese (Lixandru, 2014).
Overall, manganese absorption is at its peak when consumed in its protein- chelate state. The absorption process of manganese, which takes place in the small intestine, is relatively slow compared to many other nutrients. However, its rate of absorption is relatively high, at roughly 40% (Blaurock-Busch, 2002). Manganese absorption can also benefit slightly from both alcohol and lecithin (Haas, 2003). Manganese absorption can also be inhibited by large amounts of calcium, phosphorus, or a combination of the two. As a result of this relationship between manganese and calcium, a deficiency in calcium increases absorption of manganese (Blaurock-Busch, 2002). Iron has been known to have an inverse relationship with manganese. As iron enters the body in large amounts, the absorption of manganese decreases, and vice versa. Increased manganese absorption can be associated with iron deficiency anemia, if this enhanced absorption occurs over long periods of time. Other products have also been known to inhibit the absorption of manganese from the intestines to the bloodstream, such as zinc, cobalt, and soy protein (Haas, 2003).
Certain medications are also known to lessen the absorption of manganese, so it is ill- advised to take these medications along with manganese supplements. These medications include reserpine, antacids, laxatives, and tetracycline antibiotics. Reserpine is one of the medications commonly used to lower blood pressure, but it may also inhibit manganese absorption. Antacids and laxatives both have an inhibiting effect on manganese absorption because of their high magnesium content. If taking these medications, it is recommended to wait at least 1 to 2 hours before introducing a manganese supplement into the body (University of Maryland, 2013).
After the body has absorbed enough manganese, excess nutrient is then moved to the liver where it is regulated through the process of excreting bile, and also to other organs which are used to store the unused manganese. (Haas, 2003)

11.6.2 Functions
[
]
Manganese is considered a trace mineral and is found in small amounts throughout different parts of the body. It can be found mostly within the bones, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Even though it is rather scarce in the body, manganese helps the body in many different ways. Manganese can be used to form connective tissue, bones, sex hormones and even blood clots. It can also play a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption and blood sugar regulation (University of Maryland Medical Center, 2013).
Many manganese-activated enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of these fats and carbohydrates. For example, pyruvate carboxylase is a manganese-activated enzyme and is essential in the process of gluconeogenesis, which produces glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (Oregon State University, 2015). Arginase is another manganese-containing enzyme, and is required by the liver to help with the urea cycle, a process that makes ammonia produced during amino acid metabolism less toxic to the body (Oregon State University, 2015).
As one may see, manganese is important in regulating the metabolism of different things within the body. Manganese is also necessary in order to maintain normal brain and nerve function. It is a component of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). The purpose of SOD is to fight against free radicals, which occur naturally throughout the body, but can damage the cell membrane and can even harm DNA (University of Maryland Medical Center, 2013). SOD acts as a catalyst of the conversion of the free radicals to hydrogen peroxide, which is further reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes.
As stated previously, even though manganese is only found in small amounts in the body, it is an essential nutrient. This is because it is involved in many chemical processes such as processing cholesterol, carbohydrates and proteins. Manganese is also involved in the formation of bone, with a manganese deficiency resulting in abnormal skeletal system development. Manganese is a preferred cofactor of enzymes known as glycosyltransferases (Oregon State University, 2015). These enzymes allow for the synthesis of proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are what allow for the healthy production of cartilage and bone (Oregon State University, 2015). When the body is wounded, recovery requires an increase in the production of collagen. Prolidase, which is an enzyme that is used to form this collagen in human skin cells, requires manganese in order to be activated (PubMed, 2013). Thus, manganese is essential in the process of blood clotting and wound healing.
Though many of the functions of manganese can be generalized in its use as an activator for enzymes, it still plays an extremely important role within the body.

11.6.3 Requirements
[
]
Manganese is not readily available in the body as there are only 20 milligrams, which equates to one fiftieth of a gram, scattered throughout the bones, liver, kidneys, and pancreas. In fact, this mineral was not focused on until the 1930s when a group of researchers uncovered that human bodies require small amounts every day. There is not enough information in order to establish a proper recommended daily allowance (RDA), however, average intakes taken from a yearly survey of the overall mineral content in American diets were incorporated to determine adequate intake levels (AL) and tolerable upper intake level (UL) values. These values were established by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine. No manganese deficiency has ever been documented in humans that are consistently consuming natural diets on a daily basis. The current AL values are 2.3 milligrams per day for men and 1.8 milligrams a day for women. The UL value for adults is 11 milligrams per day.
Freeland-Graves, Bales, and Behmardi (1987) have come to the agreement that a suggested range of 3.5 to 7 milligrams per day of manganese is sufficient in both adults and adolescents.  Their reasoning comes from the basis that current diets consist of a substantial amount of meats and refined grains that leads to an imbalance in the intake of manganese.  Freeland-Graves (1988) discovered that manganese may have an even more crucial impact on women who are more prone to osteoporosis since the mineral’s role involves bone formation and stability.  Freeland-Graves et al. (1987) found that five out of seven of the males in the study who were fed a depleted diet of manganese developed a heat rash identified as Miliaria crystallina.
Maintaining a healthy level of manganese in the body is important because there are health problems associated with having too much as well as too little of the mineral in the body. A daily consumption of less than 2.3 milligrams of manganese may lead to health complications such as bone malformation, seizures, and overall weakness. Levels of manganese that are in excess place individuals at risk for neurological disorders resembling Parkinson’s disease.  Despite the given statements, the good news is that American diets usually gravitate towards being well above the required daily intake value. In conclusion, one sure fact is that manganese is a mineral that is most definitely critical to developing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Although there is not enough information to form a recommended daily intake for manganese, anywhere from 2 - 9 milligrams of dietary manganese per day is considered safe and sufficient for the average adult (Michalke & Fernsebner, 2014). The Average Intake of manganese is 2.3 mg per day for men and 1.8 mg per day for women.
Manganese Deficiency
The sufficient amount of manganese required for the average adult is low, and many plant sources (such as wheat germ, rolled oats, parsley, and soybeans) contain significant amounts of manganese. Therefore, manganese deficiency is rare. However, certain factors such as phytate intake and high iron and calcium intake may inhibit manganese absorption, so deficiency is still possible.
According to Blaurock-Busch, several symptoms of manganese deficiency are ataxia (the loss of full control of bodily movements), fainting, hearing loss, and weak tendons and ligaments. According to Watts (1990), manganese deficiencies have been studied in animals, and although the symptoms vary according to species and degree of deficiency, there are many similarities of symptoms between species. These similarities include skeletal abnormalities (which include chondrodystrophy, i.e. retarded bone growth with bowing), postural defects, impaired growth, impaired reproductive function (which is characterized by defective ovulation, increased infant mortality, and ovarian and testicular degeneration), and disturbances in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. As shown from studies involving rats, a deficiency in manganese may also lead to abnormalities in the integrity of cell membranes and mitochondria.
Watts (1990) also stated that, with one human study in particular, symptoms of manganese deficiency included hypercholesterolemia, decreased triglycerides and phospholipids, weight loss, transient dermatitis, and intermittent nausea. The subject’s hair color also changed from black to red when experiencing manganese deficiency.
Manganese Toxicity
The Upper Level for manganese is 11 mg per day and was established based on intakes from food, water, and supplements. Manganese toxicity is more likely to occur as a result of exposure to manganese in the environment (such as with inhalation of manganese by workers in factories and manganese miners) than with excessive dietary manganese.
There are three levels of manganese toxicity, according to Watts (1990). Mild toxicity leads to symptoms that include insomnia, hallucinations, muscular pains, compulsive actions, and impaired memory. Moderate toxicity leads to speech disorders, poor balance, and fine tremors. Severe toxicity leads to symptoms that are similar to those of Parkinson’s disease—rigidity, spasmodic laughter, and mask-like face.
Several factors that may increase one’s risk for manganese toxicity are alcoholism, decreased excretion, and iron deficiency.
Alcoholism can have a direct effect on how Manganese interacts with the body. Once the liver breaks down alcohol, its toxins are released and the byproducts can often damage the liver cells in the process. Once these liver cells are damaged they are unable to perform their intended task of preventing toxic substances, such as manganese, from traveling to the brain (Tarter et al. 1993). Elements such as Manganese will in turn damage brain cells, potentially leading to the serious and sometimes fatal brain disorder, Hepatic encephalopathy. This disorder ranges from mild, to severe, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, motor disturbances, coma and death (Tarter et al. 1993).
Another condition that can lead to toxicity can be linked to hepatic dysfunction. Manganese homeostasis is largely centered around liver function and the predominant cells in the liver, hepatocytes (Kies, 1994). The balance of this element is controlled by an efficient system of evacuation, where Manganese may be moved across the enterocyte and then returned to the gut lumen or excreted into feces through means of bile. Absorbed Manganese is carried to the liver by the portal blood system, where it is taken up, and therefore anything that damages or interrupts liver function could consequently diminish manganese excretion (Kies, 1994). This
could then increase Manganese retention in the body, causing reason for toxicity.
While there are few dietary nutrients that demonstrate a positive or negative interaction with Manganese, studies have revealed that Iron does in fact have a strong interaction with Manganese. (Mills, 1985). When Iron is increased in the diet, manganese absorption is diminished, and alternatively when dietary Manganese is increased, the metabolism of Iron is interrupted. A reason for this phenomenon may be that Manganese might be accepted by the transport mechanism of Iron and therefore absorbed alongside this trace mineral. (Mills, 1985) These findings have led to the conclusion that a deficiency of Iron could lead to high risk for accumulation of Manganese in the brain, which can cause abnormalities and another form of toxicity in regards to this element. Although the chance of Americans consuming too much Manganese in the diet is small, there are still situations where this could occur and cause an imbalance. Individuals should only consume the allowed daily intakes of Manganese, while not exceeding more than the Upper limit. To prevent toxicity, it is also important to limit alcohol use and consume normal amounts of other elements that may have negative impacts on Manganese absorption.

The best sources of chromium include meat, whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, and some spices. Although chromium is widely-available in all foods, most foods only provide very small amounts. Also, some foods’ chromium content depends on agricultural and manufacturing processes. Here are some foods that contain a healthy amount of chromium (NIH, 2013):

11.7.2 Functions

Chromium's role in human health is still being studied, but scientists suspect that it plays a role in maintaining proper glucose and insulin levels for type-2 diabetics. The studies, however, show that adding chromium to one's diet does not help above what a normal diet typically contains. It also seems to have no measurable effect on non-diabetic insulin-glucose management. As such, only chromium-deficient type-2 diabetics were shown to benefit from chromium supplementation. More studies need to be done to confirm even this, however, as there have been some concerns over the studies that did show improvements (NIH, 2013).
Other studies have been done to investigate whether chromium can reduce LDL cholesterol and help raise HDL cholesterol, but the results are inconclusive. Similarly, some studies have shown a slight positive effect in weight loss and lean muscle building, but the methodology has been called into question, and the results were so minor as to make little difference in the average person's weight loss strategy (NIH, 2013).
A trace mineral that is essential in aiding most bodily functions is chromium. There is some evidence of how chromium affects the body. This evidence is that chromium has interactions with certain organs, organ systems and cellular function. Chromium interacts with thyroid metabolism. Chromium (III) is the form of the element that is found in nature and is also the most stable form in biological systems (Krejpcio). When chromium (III) binds with nucleic acids, it has been yielded results that can cause one to conclude that it stimulates DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Also, chromium (III) interacts with the endocrine system, by directly affecting insulin. It does so by interacting with insulin in the first step of metabolism, when sugar enters the cell (Krejpcio). It also assists in the interaction of insulin with its receptors and the cell surface. Through this interaction with glucose, chromium also helps with the conversion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins into energy. Due to this interaction of chromium and glucose, a conclusion can be drawn that chromium may help some people with Type 2 diabetes. It can assist in the control and management of blood sugar in people with Type 2 diabetes (“Chromium Supplements: Benefits, Side Effects, Risks, and More”). Taking chromium supplements are advertised as being helpful in building muscle, burning fat and in helping the body utilize carbohydrates. There is also some evidence that chromium can affect the eyes, seeing that there is a link between low chromium levels and increased risks of glaucoma. This conclusion makes sense because glaucoma is characterized by having abnormally high pressure in the eye (“Glaucoma”) and people who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing glaucoma—so due to the fact that it is known that chromium is associated with type 2 diabetes it makes sense that there is a link between glaucoma and chromium. Chromium also helps slow down calcium loss, suggesting chromium prevents bone loss in women during menopause.

11.7.3 Requirements
[
]
For a variety of factors, including a lack of a test to determine one's stored levels, the wide-spread prevalence of it in small amount in nearly every food, and our lack of understanding of its role in the body, it has been hard to determine what an appropriate intake of chromium is. Men are encouraged to consume between 30 and 35 micrograms and women are encouraged to take in between 20 and 25 micrograms (Schiff, 2014)
11.7.4 Imbalance
[
]
Approximately 90% of American diets are low in chromium. However, it is very rare to have a chromium deficiency unless otherwise malnourished. Those who eat enough food, in general, every day will not have a chromium deficiency. However, low chromium levels can increase blood sugar, cholesterol, triglyceride levels, which could lead to an increased risk in other diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Chromium toxicity has no evidence behind what could happen, so there is no upper limit (UL) for chromium intake. People most likely to be deficient in chromium are the elderly, those who participate in lots of strenuous exercise, those who eat lots of sugary foods, and pregnant women (Ehrlich, 2014).

11.7.5 Drug Interactions
[
]
The effects of the following drugs may be enhanced if taken with more than a normal amount of chromium: Beta-blockers, corticosteroids, insulin, nicotinic acid, NSAIDs, prostaglandin inhibitors (NIH, 2013). Antacids, corticosteroids, H2 blockers, and proton-pump blockers can all affect chromium absorption. Beta-blockers, corticosteroids, insulin, nicotinic acid, NSAIDs, and prostaglandin inhibitors can all have their effects enhanced by chromium supplementation. The evidence for these interactions is limited, but because the benefits of chromium supplements are likely to be minor at best, patients taking these drugs are encouraged to talk to their health care provider before taking chromium supplements.

11.8.1 Sources
[
]
Although molybdenum can be found in a large number of plant foods its levels depend greatly on the molybdenum soil content in the regions where plants are grown.  Legumes, grain products, nuts, and leafy green vegetables are all sources of molybdenum.  Animals don’t have concentrations of the mineral that are as high but sufficient quantities for nutritional sources may be found in liver and milk.  Reaching the recommended daily intake of dairy will often be an adequate nutritional source of molybdenum in the diet.  Average dietary intake of molybdenum is difficult for researchers to determine because there isn’t yet a uniform analytical utilized in studies to determine molybdenum levels.  In addition to this reports vary widely across the globe due to the changing levels of the mineral in the soils where crops are grown.  Even with variations molybdenum intake is consistently above the daily requirement.
11.8.2 Functions

The three primary metalloenzymes which utilize molybdenum are xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase.  Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase works actively in different types of tissue to convert purines into uric acid.  A genetic condition called xanthinuria causes low output of uric acid.  This condition may eventually lead to slight myopathy in muscle tissue.
	Sulfite oxidase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of some forms of sulfite into inorganic sulfite.  Genetic conditions can cause a deficiency in sulfite oxidase that results in the death of the infant around 2–3 years of age.  Varying levels of molybdenum in the diet have not been observed causing toxic effects on this level but researchers believe that these genetic conditions are cause by a failure to synthesize the molybdopterin cofactor of these enzymes
==11.8.3 Requirements==
There are different ways to figure out the requirements of Molybdenum; these methods are to check the plasma and serum Molybdenum concentration, urinary Molybdenum levels, biochemical indicators,  and molybdenum balance (“Dietary Reference Intakes…”, 2001). There are also factors that affect the Molybdenum requirements due to interactions with other minerals and substances; tungsten, cooper and sulfate, and bioavailability factors all determine how it is absorbed.
Depending on one's age and gender, there are different requirements for the amount of Molybdenum that should be ingested everyday through one's diet. Between the ages of zero to twelve months, because there have been no sources of information as to how much Molybdenum should be ingested, the intake values that are instated are due to the Adequate Intake (AI) levels that have been instated due to the mean intake of infants that have been fed milk from humans. The study demonstrated that as the infant gets older, the levels of molybdenum decreased over time; what started at  5 µg/L went down to 1.7 µg/L over the course of almost a year. The AI for Molybdenum for infants ages zero to six months is 2 µg/day or 0.3 µg/kg/day. For ages seven to twelve months, it is 3 µg/day or 0.3 µg/kg/day. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for children one to three years is 13 µg/day and for children ages four to eight years it is 17 µg/day. After the age of eight, boys and girls require different amounts of Molybdenum. The EAR for boys ages nine to thirteen years is 26 µg/day of molybdenum and for those who are fourteen to eighteen years, the value is 33 µg/day. Additionally, the EAR for girls nine to thirteen years if 26 µg/day of molybdenum and for girls who are fourteen to eighteen years old, they need 33 µg/day. The Molybdenum Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for children ages one to three is 17 µg/day and for ages four to eight years is 22 µg/day. The RDA for boys nine to thirteen years it is 34 µg/day and for those who are fourteen to eighteen years it is 43 µg/day. Finally, the Molybdenum RDA for girls who are nine to thirteen years is 34 µg/day and for girls fourteen to eighteen years, they need 43 µg/day.
Men and women over the age of nineteen both have the same EAR and RDA values for Molybdenum (“Molybdenum”, 2006).  For men and women who are nineteen years old and greater, the EAR is 34 µg/day and the RDA is 45 µg/day. Molybdenum values for women who are pregnant between the ages of fourteen to fifty years old, are 40 µg/day for the EAR and  50 µg/day for the RDA. Additionally, for lactation, between the years of fourteen to eighteen the EAR is 35 µg/day and the RDA is 50 µg/day; then from ages nineteen to fifty, the EAR value increases slightly to 36 µg/day and the RDA remains the same 50 µg/day.
There are also upper level intake values that can pose to be toxic if one goes above it. Children one to three years cannot go above 300 µg/day, four to eight years cannot go above 600 µg/day, nine to thirteen year old cannot go above 1,100 µg/day, and children fourteen to eighteen cannot pass 1,700 µg/day. Adult men and women above the age of nineteen should not surpass 2,000 µg/day. Pregnant women should not go above 1,700 µg/day if they are fourteen to eighteen years old, and they need to stay below 2,000 µg/day if they are nineteen to fifty years old. If one is lactating, the same values as pregnant women are instated. High levels are not recommended because even though a human model has not been completed and there are mostly animal studies, in a mouse study, high levels of Molybdenum lead to carcinogenic results (“Molybdenum”, 2013).  Toxicity can also lead to problems regarding growth, less hemoglobin, renal failure, and problems with the reproductive system (Novotny, 2006). Additionally, a deficiency, even though they are not common, can lead to reproductive problems and problems again with growth.

11.8.4 Imbalance
[
]
Deficiencies in molybdenum have only been recorded in humans in a few cases that have not been replicated.  In one study two young men with Crohn’s disease had very extensive losses of trace minerals.  These participants had symptoms of elevated uric acid levels in their plasma and urine after infusion with molybdenum, consistent with the purpose of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase. While this shows that molybdenum is utilized and essential in trace quantities it does not provide researchers any information with which to calculate a minimum dietary recommendation.
Molybdenum toxicity is known as molybdenosis.  Some of the most prevalent symptoms in molybdenum toxicity are actually those of copper deficiency because the excess molybdenum interferes with the utilization of copper by the body.  Other effects of toxicity are thought to be kidney damage and reproductive abnormalities.  Molybdenosis is very rare in humans and most of the research done on intake of the mineral has been conducted in animal studies.  Ruminants, specifically, are more sensitive to molybdenum and therefore can be more easily utilized in studies for toxicity but this often is not relevant information when applied to human health.
	There are many surfacing claims about other health effects of molybdenum but almost all require further investigation.  Molybdenum deficiency has been linked to cancer in both the Bantu tribes of Africa and in the Hunan province of China, where naturally low soil levels of the mineral can be found.  Studies that which reported that molybdenum may be anticariogenic, or prevent dental caries, were deemed inconclusive but warranted further investigation.  There has also been evidence that areas where Keshan’s disease is prevalent also have low levels of molybdenum in the soil and that upon fertilization with the mineral the prevalence decreased.

11.9 Fluoride
[
]
Although fluoride will not appear on the periodic table, it is a naturally occurring material. This material can be found in water, animals, soil, and even plants. Fluoride protects individuals from cavities while strengthening the outer layers of their teeth; this protection works against acid that causes tooth deterioration.
Fluoride can be obtained through drinking water. “From 1966 to 1994, the percentage of 12 year-olds in the United States with decayed, missing (due to cavities) or filled teeth declined 68% (CDC, 2003).” For the past couple of centuries, there have been additions of fluoride to water supplies to assist in preventing tooth decay. The concentration of fluoride in water was increased to about 0.7 mg per liter of water. Statistics show that before this water fluoridation, children in local areas had about three times as many cavities. Following this introduction to water supplies, the Center for Disease Control ruled that this was one of the top ten advancements of public health of the twentieth century.
In the body, fluoride works with other minerals in mineralizing bones and teeth. However, fluoride takes the role of replacing the hydroxyl bonds of the crystals formed in this process, called fluorapatite (which helps to build up the strength in teeth and prevent decay). In dentistry, about 95% of the population have some sort of oral issue. Problems such as deteriorated teeth, missing teeth, or artificial enhanced teeth are incorporated in this number. While these issues may seem to be simple, a simple tooth ache can result in a chain reaction of problems to an individual’s health. Headaches, problems eating, etc., are problems that should never be overlooked. With the introduction of fluoride, these problems will not completely erase. However, the chances for these problems to take place are greatly decreased. (Bi WJ, 2010)
While fluoride can enhance protection of teeth, it can also be a detriment when too much of it is consumed. Fluorosis is the act of damaging teeth with too much fluoride. In patients where there is too much fluoride, there will be a presence of white pecks on the teeth. However, in extreme cases the teeth can be a permanently stained. This condition can only occur doing the development stages of teeth, and is permanent. It is imperative that teeth are well taken care of in the first couple of years in lives of children. Also making sure that children are not swallowing toothpaste or mouthwashes can help prevent this issue.
Fluoride is a natural mineral that helps protect teeth. Everyday, teeth go through mineralization and demineralization; the enamel gets broken down (demineralization) and built back up (mineralization).  During mineralization, there are these tiny crystals that are called hydroxyapatite (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). The teeth become stronger and more resistant to decay due to fluoride, which replaces the hydroxol portions of the hydroxyapatite crystal, forming fluorapatite (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). With fluoride, teeth can fight acid and other factors that lead to tooth decay, one of the top health problems in the United States. A very large margin of the U.S. population (roughly 95%) has had some sort of dental issue, whether the tooth (or teeth) was decayed, filled, or missing (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). Stemming from a lack of fluoride is decay, which can lead to a multitude of other issues. Included in these issues is tooth loss and overall mass tooth decay, which can inhibit the ability to chew and consume a variety of different foods.

11.9.1 Sources

Fluoride, an anion of the chemical element fluorine, can be found across the globe.  It is a natural component of the earth’s crust (ATSDR, 2003) and it is present in trace amounts as a mineral in soil, although quantities vary depending on the natural characteristics of soil in different areas, and in some rocks.  Furthermore, fluoride is present to an extent in natural water sources, including oceans.  Plants can absorb fluoride from the surrounding soil when they absorb water through their roots.  Animals, including humans, can then gain fluoride by consuming these plants and natural water sources.  Additional natural sources of fluoride include seafood and tea (Whitney, 2013).
With an adequate intake (“adequate intake” is a recommended value for nutrient intake created when a recommended daily allowance cannot be calculated (Whitney, 2013)) set at 4 milligrams per day (mg/day) for men and 3 mg/day for women, it is virtually impossible to meet daily recommendations for fluoride through only consuming these natural sources.  This is evident when one looks at a 2005 USDA report that catalogued the average fluoride content for some common sources; the fresh fruit with the highest fluoride concentration was grapes at only 8 micrograms per 100 grams and the majority of vegetables came in under 10 micrograms per 100 grams (Nutrient, 2005).  The primary source of fluoride, particularly in American diets, is artificial water fluoridation.  This is supported by the 2005 USDA report.
Public water supply has been artificially fluoridated (having fluoride added) in the United States to some extent since 1945, after researchers concluded that increased fluoride levels resulted in fewer dental caries and better overall teeth and oral health.  Fluoridation spread throughout the country and is now commonplace.  In 2004, 67% of those individuals that utilized a public water system received artificially fluoridated water (Tiemann, 2008).  The optimal fluoridation level recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is between 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams per liter.  The lower end of this range is recommended for warmer climates, where more water is expected to be consumed on average, and the upper end is recommended for colder climates, where less water is consumed on average (Committee, 2006). Artificial fluoridation is also supported by the World Health Organization for areas where natural fluoride levels are low (Tiemann, 2008).
Depending on the bottler and water source, fluoride may or may not be present in bottled water (Nutrient, 2005).
Another major source of fluoride is toothpaste.  Fluoride toothpaste is used by over 90% of the United States’ population.  Toothpaste, as a source of fluoride, differs from other sources because it applies the fluoride topically, directly to the teeth, rather than through ingestion.  This has been shown to be a more effective manner of preventing dental caries, however public water remains an integral source of fluoride and a major contributor to dental health.  A 2010 study concluded that primarily using non-fluoridated water was one of the top three factors associated with dental problems in teens (Campaign, 2015).
In summary, fluoride can be found in trace amounts in many foods (including fruits, vegetables, and beef) as well as natural water sources, but the primary source is artificially fluoridated public water.  Other than fluoridated water, the top sources for fluoride are tea, seafood, and toothpaste.

“How does one get fluoride?” someone may ask. The most common source of fluoride is actually found in drinking water. According to the American Dental Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has proclaimed community water fluoridation one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th Century (“Fluoride”, n.d.). Oddly enough though, fluoridated water is more easily found in tap water than bottled water, as traditional bottled water is not fluorinated unless specified (Whitney & Rolfes, 2013). According to the CDC, the goal by 2020 is to have 79.6% of people on public water to have access to fluorinated water (“Water Fluoridation Data & Statistics”, 2015). There are various maps and websites online that can show by state and even by county the level of fluoridation in the water. In addition to water, fluoride can also be found in another everyday usage. As obvious as it may seem, brushing with fluoridated toothpaste has dropped the number of cavities drastically over the years. When one sees a product with the ADA Seal of Approval, they can be sure they are getting a product that comes from a safe and effective lab, uses FDA-approved ingredients, comes from a company that uses scientifically based ads and packaging, and comes from the highest manufacturing standards (“ADA Seal of Acceptance Program and Products”, n.d.). While brushing, one can actually get two sources of fluoride at once with the toothpaste and the water. Mouthwashes also contain fluoride, which are another essential part to the dental hygiene regime to keep one’s mouth happy and healthy. If a child has serious risk of developing cavities due to lack of fluoride in the water supply and through poor dental hygiene, a doctor may prescribe a fluoride supplement if needed (“Fluoride”, n.d.). This is why it is important to start children young when it comes to dental hygiene. It has been shown that fluoride toothpastes can reduce the number of cavities in children by 15%-30% and the fluoridation of water can reduce the risk by up to another 40% (Zissu, 2014)!

In 1945 the United States government issued the process of community water fluoridation (Long & Zhang 2009). Since then fluoride has been added to toothpaste, food items, dental treatment, dental implants, and many antibiotics. This increase in the consumption of fluoride has led many to observe the biological effects of fluoride imbalance in relation to the human body. In taking an excess amount of fluoride presents a numerous amount of potential problems, but seems to have a noticeably negative effect on hormones.
Studies have shown that excess fluoride can negatively affect both male and female sex hormones. Researchers in China developed study in which some men were exposed to high doses of fluoride each day, while others obtained a regular amount each day. Those who consumed more fluoride than required expressed significantly lower levels of testosterone, decreased sperm levels, reduced fertility rates, and physical changes in the reproductive system (Long & Zhang). In relation to the effects of excess fluoride on the sexual hormones in women, studies have shown drastic decreases in fertility rates, as well as decreased in progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone (Freni 1994).
Increased fluoride consumption can also be correlated to an increase in occurrences of underactive thyroid. Although no cause and effect relationship has been proven, researchers advise caution when consuming fluoride. A study led by Stephen Peckham was created to find scientific evidence that fluoride indeed has an opposing effect on the thyroid gland. The study revealed that cities with tap water that exceeded 0.3 milligrams of fluoride per liter, were 30% more likely to experience underactive thyroid glands compared to other residents (Mezitis 2015).
Children are at a greater risk of fluoride imbalance due to their disproportionate body size. Children between the age of one and seven cannot drink more than one liter of water that has went through fluoridation, without receiving excess fluoride (Caries 1993). It is essentially to inhibit children of these ages from using fluoride based toothpaste in order to avoid any thyroid defects, and reproductive alterations.
Because there is no essential requirement for fluoride in the body, it is easy to intake more than necessary. If there is a zero intake of fluoride in the body, no deficiency state will occur. The only true need presented to us by toothpaste commercials, and dentist is the need to fight cavities, and build stronger, cleaner, and more sustainable teeth. With this in mind, it is important for individuals to know that fluoride is not a necessity, but an option. When consuming fluoride, it is important to monitor the amounts, and take caution.

12.1.1 Glycolysis
[
]
Written by: André Cunha
Metabolism is broadly deﬁned as the sum of biochemical processes in living organisms that either produce or consume energy (DeBerardinis, R.J et al. 2012).  Core metabolism can be simpliﬁed to those pathways involving abundant nutrients like carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, essential for energy homeostasis and macromolecular synthesis in humans. Pathways of core metabolism can then be separated conveniently into three classes: those that synthesize simple molecules or polymerize them into more complex macromolecules (anabolism); those that degrade molecules to release energy (catabolism); and those that help to eliminate the toxic waste produced by the other classes (waste disposal). These pathways are profoundly important. Stated bluntly, they are the sole source of energy that allows life to resist the urge to degrade into entropy (DeBerardinis, R.J. 2012; Nelson, D & Cox, M. 2011).
Glucose occupies a central position in the metabolism of plants, animals and many microorganisms. It has relatively high potential energy and therefore it is a good fuel: the full oxidation of one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water occurs in a range of standard free energy of - 2840 kJ/mol. By means of storage of glucose as a polymer of high molecular mass, such as starch and glycogen, the cell can store large quantities of hexose units while maintaining the cytosolic osmolarity relatively low. When the demand for energy increases, glucose can be converted from such intracellular storages into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in an aerobic or anaerobic manner. (Nelson, D & Cox, M. 2011; Stryer, L. 2008).
Glucose is not only an excellent fuel, but it is also a precursor admirably versatile, able to meet a variety of metabolic intermediates in biosynthetic reactions (FIGURE 02). A bacterium like Escherichia coli can use the glucose as carbon skeletons for every amino acid, nucleotide, enzyme, fatty acid or other metabolic intermediate required for their growth (Nelson, D & Cox, M. 2011)
Glycolysis literally means "splitting sugars." In glycolysis, glucose (a six carbon sugar) is split into two molecules of a three-carbon sugar. Glycolysis yields two molecules of ATP (free energy containing molecule), two molecules of pyruvic acid and two "high energy" electron carrying molecules of NADH. Glycolysis can occur with or without oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, glycolysis allows cells to make small amounts of ATP. This process is called fermentation.
Glycolysis (from glycose, an older term for glucose + -lysis degradation) is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO− + H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy compounds ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
Glycolysis is a definite sequence of ten reactions involving ten intermediate compounds (one of the steps involves two intermediates). The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis. For example, most monosaccharides, such as fructose, glucose, and galactose, can be converted to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful. For example, the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.
It occurs, with variations, in nearly all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of glycolysis indicates that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways. It occurs in the cytosol of the cell.
The most common type of glycolysis is the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP pathway), which was first discovered by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas. Glycolysis also refers to other pathways, such as the Entner–Doudoroff pathway and various heterofermentative and homofermentative pathways. However, the discussion here will be limited to the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway.
The entire glycolysis pathway can be separated into two phases (FIGURE 1):
The Preparatory Phase – in which ATP is consumed and is hence also known as the investment phase
The PayOff Phase – in which ATP is produced.
In glycolysis, one molecule of glucose is degraded into a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, generating two molecules of the compound in three carbon atoms, pyruvate. During these sequential reactions part of glycolysis of glucose free energy is conserved as ATP and NADH (Nelson, D & Cox, M. 2011; Stryer, L. et al. 2008).
The glycolytic pathway (FIGURE 01) starts when glucose enters the cell through glucose transporters (GLUTs) and, once inside, it is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase 2 (HK2). Phosphoglucose isomerase catalyzes G6P to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), which yields fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), and then pyruvate and ATP by pyruvate kinase (PK) in the final step of glycolysis. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle. Ultimately, glycolysis produces two ATP molecules and six NADH molecules per unit of glucose. In normal tissues, most of the pyruvate is directed into the mitochondrion to be converted into acetyl-CoA by the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or transaminated to form alanine (Marie, S. Shinjo, S. 2011; DeBerardinis, R.J. 2012).
FIGURE 01: The glycolytic pathway
FIGURE 02: The main routes of glucose utilization. Although it is not the only possible glucose ways, these four paths are most significant in terms of quality of glucose that flows through them in the majority of cells.
According to Marie and Shinjo (2011), for normal cells to produce two viable daughter cells at mitosis, all the cellular contents must be replicated, and energy is necessary for this to happen. Glucose participates in cellular energy production with two ATP synthesis through glycolysis and up to 36 ATPs through its complete catabolism by the TCA cycle and OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation). The large requirements for nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids for the daughter cells are provided by intermediate metabolites of these pathways.
In addition to glucose, glutamine is the other molecule catabolized in appreciable quantities for most mammalian cells in culture. Both molecules supply carbon, nitrogen, free energy, and reducing equivalents necessary to support cell growth and division. This means that glucose, in addition to being used for ATP synthesis, should also be diverted to macromolecular precursors such as acetyl-CoA for fatty acids, glycolytic intermediates for non-essential amino acids, and ribose for nucleotides to generate biomass (Marie, S. Shinjo, S. 2011; Nelson, D & Cox, M. 2011; Stryer, L. et al. 2008).
Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis
Glycolysis (solid lines) is the main pathway of glucose oxidation and it occurs in the cytosol of all cells, including but not limited to red blood cells, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and brain. It is commonly split into two phases: the preparatory phase and the payoff phase. The goal of the preparatory phase is to phosphorylate glucose and convert it to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, while the payoff phase oxidizes glyceraldehyde 3-phopshate to pyruvate and forms ATP and NADH. For every molecule of glucose that undergoes glycolysis there is a net gain of 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
Gluconeogenesis (dotted lines) is the metabolic pathway through which precursors such as lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and amino acids are converted to glucose. Gluconeogenesis requires three bypass steps due to the large negative ∆G˚ for these reactions (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase-1 and hexokinase). The first bypass step is broken down into two enzymatic steps. The first of these occurs in the mitochondria of the cell and is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, while the second is the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate it shuttled into the cytoplasm as malate, once in the cytosol it is oxidized back into oxaloacetate that is then converted to PEP. The second bypass step is the dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; it is highly regulated and is a highly exergonic, irreversible hydrolysis reaction. The third bypass step is the dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate; it is present in liver, renal cells and intestinal epithelial cells, but not in muscle or other tissues.

12.1.2 Gluconeogenesis
[
]
Introduction
As the name implies, this process calls for the synthesis of new glucose. However, the production of this glucose comes from non-carbohydrate sources such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol and alanine. Gluconeogenesis for the most part occurs in the liver but the kidney and small intestine may also house pathways for this activity. It is a constant occurrence in the liver in order to maintain blood glucose levels and to meet the demands that organs such as the brain, heart and skeletal muscles have but very little gluconeogenesis takes place in these areas (Ophardt, 2003). Many believe that this procedure is just the reverse reactions of glycolysis and although most steps are similar to these, there are unique properties in particular reactions that only pertain to gluconeogenesis.
Why does This Take Place?
Our body is usually in one of two states, fed or fasted. When we have a constant or timely intake of food throughout the day, such forms get digested and the resulting glucose is then absorbed for direct use in maintaining our blood glucose level. Conversely, when we are not eating and glycogen levels are depleted, absent of filled stores in the liver unlike during the fed state, this is where gluconeogenesis is necessary. Overnight fasting, starvation, pregnancy, lactation, traumatic injury, and exercise are situations in which the demand for this process rises. Hypoglycaemia occurs when one has an abnormally low blood glucose concentration and this poses a particular problem for the body which can be even potentially life-threatening because the brain and red blood cells depend on glucose as a source of energy and the key metabolic pathway that guards against it is gluconeogenesis (Barrit & Wallace, 2002).
Challenges
In the process of glycolysis, ten enzymes are used in the synthesis of pyruvate from glucose. As mentioned before, gluconeogenesis can be seen to be the reverse reactions of glycolysis but there is a key difference. Only seven out of the ten enzymes are the same in both processes because three reactions have to be bypassed. This is due to the fact that in glycolysis, too large of a negative delta G value or free energy change occurs as a result of the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase-1 and hexokinase, which ultimately causes these three reactions to be irreversible. (Diwan, 2007). The new enzymes that are unique to the gluconeogenic pathway are pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-1,6-biphosphate and glucose-6-phosphate which catalyze the reactions for bypass of the pyruvate kinase reaction, phosphofructokinase-1 reaction and hexokinase reaction respectively.

The storage of glucose in the body is called glycogen. Glycogen can be converted to glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis when blood glucose levels are low. The biosynthesis of new glucose through non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as amino acids, pyruvate, and glycerol is called gluconeogenesis. This process occurs mainly in the liver, and to a short extent in the kidney and small intestines. In this process two moles of pyruvate are converted to two moles of biphosphoglycerate, which consumes six moles ATP in the form of energy (King, M 2015). Since so much energy is used this process it is considered very costly from the energy standpoint.
Most of the same enzymes used in glycolysis are used in gluconeogenesis in the synthesis of glucose from pyruvate. The main source of carbon atoms for synthesizing glucose during gluconeogenesis is lactate. Pyruvate becomes reduced to lactate with the aide of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For lactate to form, the lactate dehydrogenase needs the help of NADH, and then will yield NAD+ in the process. The NAD+ then becomes readily available so it can then be used by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of the glycolysis reaction. After these two reactions take place they become coupled during anaerobic glycolysis. In the step that follows, the lactate that was produced by the lactate dehydrogenase reaction is released within the bloodstream, transported to the liver and then converted to glucose. The glucose loops back to the blood where it is then used for the muscles as an energy source. This process is known as the Cori cycle (King, M 2015).
There are three reactions in glycolysis that are essentially irreversible, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase. In order for gluconeogenesis to occur appropriately those three reactions of glycolysis have to be skipped or bypassed. There is a forward reaction catalyzed by glycolysis enzymes paired with a bypass reaction catalyzed by gluconeogenesis enzymes (Diwan, J 2007).
Hexokinase (Glycolysis):
Glucose + ATP⇒glucose-6-phosphate + ADP
Glucose-6-phosphotase (Gluconeogenesis):
Glucose-6-phosphate + H2O⇒glucose + Pi
Phosphofructokinase (Glycolysis):
Fructose-6-phosphate+ATP⇒fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate+ADP
Fructose-1, 6-bispospatase (Gluconeogenesis):
Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphtase + H2O⇒fructose-6-phopspate+Pi
Pyruvate Kinase (Glycolysis):
Phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP ⇒pyruvate + ATP
(Diwan, J 2007)
The pathways of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are strictly controlled in order to insure that they do not take place at the same time in the same cell. This is important because if both are working at the same time then there will be a loss of 2 ATPs and 2 GTPs and in the end there is no net gain of anything. Pathways that continuously result in zero net change are recognized as a futile cycle (Berg, JM, Tymoczko, JL & Stryer L, 2002).

12.1.3 Lactic Acid
[
]
Lactic acid, an organic compound that can be produced naturally or synthetically is a white, water-soluble or clear liquid. In contrast to what the name advocates, it does not come from milk, but it is actually an acid ingredient in sour dairy, fermented fruits and vegetables, and sausages. Found in animals and humans, it is the most important source related to supply energy in muscle tissue and formed from the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen when oxygen supply is inadequate. Many misconceptions about lactic acid state that it is deemed to be one of the causes of both fatigue during exercise and the stiffness felt afterwards. However, it is actually a vital fuel used by the muscles during extensive periods of exercise. (What Is the Fermentation That Happens When Lactic Acid Builds Up and Your Muscles Get Sore? (n.d.). Retrieved December 3, 2015, from
http://livehealthy.chron.com/fermentation-happens-lactic-acid-builds-up-muscles-sore-5577.html
). Because lactate can be oxidized in another muscle it helps postpone the onset of fatigue and improvement in sport performance. Accumulation of this acid occurs only during a short sessions of exercise that tend to be at high intensity and because it is rapidly removed from the blood and muscle after exercise, it is very unlikely that lactate is the root of muscle soreness. On the other hand, during an exercise that focuses on endurance, the reduction of muscle glycogen causes fatigue. In this situation, lactate can operate as an energy source. By reasoning of its insulin independence, lactate has the capability of providing a readily available energy substrate. The spike in blood lactate levels throughout exercising is eased by acclimation and can be related to enhanced performance.  (WebExercises | Does Lactic Acid Cause Muscle Soreness? (n.d.). Retrieved December 3, 2015, from
https://www.webexercises.com/2007/08/does-lactic-acid-cause-muscle-soreness.html
). Resulting in the idea that training and lactate supplementation has the ability to proliferate the clearance of lactate. Being seen in a wide range of food products, lactic acid is most commonly served as a pH regulator or a preservative and occasionally a flavoring agent. Other than food, lactic acid can be seen used in pharmacy, biomaterials, technically, and detergents. The production of lactic acid comes from sucrose or glucose, water, and lime or chalk, which then goes through lactic acid fermentation with the help of bacteria. Now being considered crude calcium lactate, the removal of gypsum turns the calcium lactate into crude lactic acid with the final process being purification and concentration creating the end product; lactic acid. In reference to the environment pH, lactic acid is one example of a weak acid, which can be present as the acid in its associated form as the ion salt in higher pH or its associated form at a low pH. Most of the lactic acid in the body will dissociate and be present as lactate. Being in the unionized form, the substrates are capable of being abe to pass through the lipid membranes, which is different from the ionized form, unable to pass through the membranes.

12.2 Amino Acids
[
]
Amino acids are the monomers of proteins and are an essential part of human growth, development, and health. There are a total of twenty amino acids, with Asparagine being the first to be discovered in 1806. Amino acids are all composed of a carboxyl group, an amino group, and a hydrogen atom bonded to the same carbon atom-the alpha carbon (Basic Structure, 2003). They differ from one another in their side chains, or the R groups bonded to the alpha carbon. The R groups of the different amino acids can differ in size and structure, as well as electric charge (acidic or basic), which influences the solubility of the amino acids in water (Nelson and Cox, 2013).
There are twenty amino acids that are generally found in proteins, and they are: Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Proline, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan, Serine, Cysteine, Threonine, Asparagine, Glutamine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, Histidine, Lysine, and Arginine. Proteins are broken down using hydrolysis reactions in which a water molecule is added to the protein, and this results in individual amino acids being formed. Proteins are synthesized using dehydration reactions (condensation reaction), in which a molecule of water is removed and a peptide bond forms between the amino acids. When two amino acids are joined together, the resulting molecule is called a dipeptide. When three are joined together, the molecule is called a tripeptide (Whitney and Rolfes, 2015). As a chain of many amino acids forms and grows, the chain is called a polypeptide.
The human body needs and uses the different amino acids to make proteins to help the body: 1) Metabolize food, 2) Repair torn or damaged body tissues, 3) Grow, and 4) Perform other important body functions (Amino acids, 2013).
The twenty amino acids are separated into three groups: 1) Essential amino acids, 2) Nonessential amino acids, and 3) Conditional Amino Acids. Essential amino acids are the amino acids that the body cannot synthesize by itself or cannot make in adequate quantities. Instead it must get these amino acids through food obtained in the diet. There are a total of nine essential amino acids. These are: Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Threonine, Histidine, Lysine, Phenylalanine, and Tryptophan. The nonessential amino acids are those that the body can synthesize by itself and make in large enough quantities. There are 11 nonessential amino acids and they can be supplied by food in the diet but it is not a requirement. Nonessential amino acids can be produces as long as there is a supply of Nitrogen to produce the amino group of the amino acid and pieces of fat or carbohydrates to form the rest of the structure. Conditional amino acids are amino acids that are usually nonessential but become essential during times of stress, illness, or other special circumstances. One such illness is Phenylketonuria, an inherited disease in which the nonessential amino acid tyrosine becomes essential because the body cannot convert phenylalanine into tyrosine (Whitney and Rolfes, 2015).
There are several foods that one should eat to obtain all essential amino acids. These foods include: beans, chicken, lean meat, fish, nuts and seeds, peanut butter, tofu, lentils and many others (Protein in diet, 2013).

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, an amino acid is defined as “an amphoteric organic acid containing the amino group NH2.” In simpler terms, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. All amino acids are composed of an amino group (NH2), an acid group (COOH), a hydrogen atom, a central carbon atom, and a side group. The side group is what distinguishes all the different amino acids from each other.
There are 20 amino acids. Of the 20 amino acids, 11 are nonessential, meaning that they can be produced and synthesized by the body. The remaining nine are essential, which means that they must be obtained from food. The essential amino acids are either not produced at all by the body or are not produced in sufficient amounts. Some amino acids are conditionally essential, meaning that they are normally nonessential, but must be obtained from the diet under special circumstances (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).
In order to be used in the metabolic pathway, amino acids must undergo deamination. Deamination means they lose their nitrogen-containing amino group, and the only thing left is the carbon skeleton. After this process, they are able to enter the TCA cycle (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).
Citations: Whitney, Ellie & Rolfes, Sharon R. (2015). Understanding nutrition (14th ed.). Canada: Cengage Learning.
The structure of a basic amino acid consists of a central carbon (C), an amino group (NH2), am atom of hydrogen (H), and an acid group (CHO2). Unlike carbohydrates or lipids, amino acids have a varying side group, or R-group, which occupies the remaining bond on the carbon and differentiates the twenty amino acids from each other. This R-group can be rather simple, being a hydrogen atom on the amino acid glycine, or rather complex as it is on the amino acid phenylalanine which has a multi carbon-hydrogen R-group (Whitney/Rolfes, 2013).
Overall there are two types of amino acids regarding human nutrition, essential and nonessential. Nonessential amino acids are ones that the human body can produce by itself using bodily nitrogen and excess carbs and lipids for the remaining carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen pieces of the amino acid. There are eleven nonessential amino acids and they include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine. Most proteins usually contain nonessential amino acids but it is not a requirement for our diet. On the other hand, essential amino acids are required in the human diet as they cannot be synthesized by the body. There are nine essential amino acids including histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. It is not necessarily vital to eat essential and nonessential proteins at every meal but it is important to balance their intake throughout the day (National Library of Medicine, 2015). There are special cases though in which one must include a nonessential amino acid into their diet for specific reasons, making this amino acid conditionally essential. For people with a disease known as phenylketonuria for example, they must include the nonessential amino acid tyrosine in their diet as tyrosine is made from phenylalanine, and if there is a complication in absorbing phenylalanine, than tyrosine has become conditionally essential for that person (Whitney/ Rolfes, 2013). Initially in a newborn only five of the nonessential amino acids are actually nonessential while the rest are conditionally essential until the body develops enough so that it can create the remaining nonessential amino acids in an efficient manner.
A protein is made by amino acids being linked together during a condensation reaction forming a dipeptide, tripeptide, or a polypeptide. The type of the amino acids and the order in which they sequence is vital as this directly determines the shape and function of the resulting protein (Australian Nutrient Reference Values, 2014). The general sequence of the amino acids in the amino acid chain determines what’s called its primary structure. The weak electrical charges with that polypeptide then determine the way one part of the chain interacts with another, creating its secondary structure. The unique side group on each amino acid and the way this side group interacts with the surrounding area determines the polypeptide’s tertiary structure. Then, if this polypeptide’s function requires that it binds with one or more other polypeptide then that creates a multiple polypeptide structure, or a quaternary structure.

Amino acids can be classified on the basis of essentiality, polarity, hydrophobia and their fate within the body once consumed. Specifically, amino acids can be separated into two groups according to the futures of their carbon fragments following deamination. If a carbon fragment later becomes a component of glucose, the amino acid to which it belongs is called a glucogenic amino acid (Whitney, 2002, p. 183). Specifically, if an amino acid becomes a pyruvate or a pyruvate-associated molecule within the Krebs Cycle, it is considered glucogenic. The production of glucose from glucogenic amino acids through a process called gluconeogenesis (closely associated with the Krebs cycle) occurs in the liver. In the first step of this two-step process, glucogenic amino acids are converted to alpha keto acids. In the second, alpha keto acids become glucose (Schutz, 2011).
There are thirteen known glucogenic amino acids in the human body. Some examples of glucogenic amino acids in humans are glycine (used in some pharmaceuticals and metal finishing), serine (important in biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines), valine, and histidine (precursor for histamine and carnosine synthesis). There are also some amino acids which can be considered both glucogenic and ketogenic, including tyrosine (important role in photosynthesis and signal transduction processes), tryptophan (essential amino acid important in protein biosynthesis) and phenylalanine (used in norepinephrine and epinephrine synthesis).

A glucogenic amino acid is one that can be converted to pyruvate and can provide glucose. Thus, proteins are a good source of glucose when carbohydrates are not available. According to King (2015), “all amino acids except lysine and leucine are at least partly glucogenic.” Amino acids that are made into glucose go through a process known as glucogenesis. Glucogenesis occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys under certain circumstances, such as starvation. When amino acids are not used to make glucose, they are used instead as an energy source for other body cells (Walker & Rolfes, 2015).

12.2.2 Ketogenic
[
]
If the carbon fragment within an amino acid later becomes a component of ketone bodies, fats or sterols rather than glucose as in glucogenic amino acids, the amino acid is ketogenic. However, there are also some ketogenic amino acids that can also be considered glucogenic depending on the fate of their carbon fragment (such as tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan). By definition, ketogenic amino acids are those that can be degraded directly into acetyl CoA which is the precursor to ketone bodies (Noguchi, 2010). Only two known amino acids are exclusively ketogenic in the human body: leucine and lysine. Leucine is used in formation of sterols in muscle and adipose tissue whereas lysine is closely correlated to serotonin function.
	There are five amino acids known in the human body which are both ketogenic and glucogenic, including isoleucine (involved in gluconeogenesis and Acetyl CoA), phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and threonine (precursor to glycine). While there are no disease specifically associated with any of the ketogenic amino acids, there is some evidence which indicates that ketogenic essential amino acid replacement diets can decrease the effects of a liver ailment known as hepatic steatosis in mice (Xu, 2013).

Ketogenic amino acids are those that make acetyl CoA, but cannot make glucose. King (2015) states that “lysine and leucine are the only amino acids that are solely ketogenic.” Ketogenic amino acids are converted into ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are acidic compounds and are produced by the liver when carbohydrates are not available and fats do not completely break down. Ketone bodies are normally produced and used in small enough amounts that provide the brain cells with fuel. Keto acids are compounds that contain a carbonyl group. When there are too many keto acids in the body, blood pH drops, signaling that the body’s chemistry is not in balance. This is known as ketosis. Ketosis also causes a loss of appetite, which may be beneficial when food is unavailable. Once a person is able to eat again, appetite returns and the body leaves ketosis (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).

12.2.3 Urea
[
]
Proteins from diet can be broken down in the liver or in muscle through several processes. These proteins are broken down into amino acids and those amino acids have to further dispose of their amino groups. This process can occur through transamination which is the removal of the amino group. This allows the resulting parts of the amino acid to be utilized for energy. However, these amino acids must be removed from the body because a build up of amino groups could be a potential toxin for body. Even in small amounts amino groups could be fatal towards an individual. Essentially, urea is created when proteins are broken down. The process by which the urea is safely removed from the body is called the Urea Cycle (also referred to as the ornithine cycle.  The Urea cycle occurs in the liver and is the main method in removing excess nitrogen from the body. In addition, the Urea cycle works in unity with the citric acid cycle as well. This is accomplished through the exchanging different intermediates and substances needed for each reaction.
Urea is typically removed from the body by way of blood. Urea travels through the body from the liver to the kidney. There the kidney filters out the Urea from blood and it excreted out of the body in urine. However, there are tests that can be performed to see the blood urea nitrogen (Chemistry).This test is very important to see if an individual's liver and kidney are healthy and functioning.  If a person's blood nitrogen level is higher than normal it could mean that the liver or kidney are not functioning properly (Webmd) . Doctors will be able to tell if individual has disease in her kidney through these tests. Some of these diseases could be either acute kidney failure or end stage renal disease (Webmd). Urea is the main end product of nitrogen metabolism.
Urea was first discovered by German chemist Friedrich Wohler in 1828 while he was  trying to make ammonium cyanate from from silver cyanide and ammonium chloride. However, by mistake he ended up making Urea. Organically, Urea is a carbamide which a compound that is made up of two amino groups that are linked by a carbonyl (Boswick). Some of the main qualities of Urea is that it does not smell, has no color, and is water soluble. The reason behind urea being soluble is that in water it can get displaced into ammonium ion and bicarbonate ion. The water solubility is why urea is excreted in urine because it is the most efficient process. Urea is also utilized outside the body as well. For example, Urea is one main components of fertilizer. In addition, Urea can be synthetically made to be utilized for plastic, glue, detergent, or even pesticides (Boswick). This illustrates that Urea could have many potential uses not just used in the body.
Ammonia is a highly toxic substance to humans. If not excreted from the body, its accumulation can lead to liver damage, and even death (Ophardt, 2003). Ammonia is cleared from the body via urea. Urea is made in the liver and is excreted in the kidneys as urine. Urea is the main excretion method of unused nitrogen. The more protein a person consumes, the more urea is produced. In order to keep urea in solution, water must also be consumed. Thus, a person who eats a lot of protein must also drink a lot of water. This will help to dilute and excrete urea. If a person on a high-protein diet doesn’t drink enough water, they may become dehydrated. Without extra water, the body uses its stored water to get rid of urea. This is why it is common to see water loss in those who eat a lot of protein. Losing water makes high-protein diets seem effective, but actually has no value to losing body fat (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).

Glycerol and fatty acids
Citric Acid cycle
12.3 Glycerol and Fatty Acids
[
]
<nowiki>Glycerol and Fatty Acids are components of triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of lipid, or fat, primarily responsible for taste and texture of foods, energy storage, supplying essential fatty acids, and carrying fat-soluble compounds. They account for most of the fat found in your body and in your foods (Ikechik, 2009, Introduction section, para. 1). Most commonly, triglycerides are found as saturated fat in foods such as meat, butter, and high-fat dairy products. It is important to recognize what happens to these triglycerides after consumption.
	To understand how triglycerides are metabolized, it is essential to understand that a triglyceride is made of a glycerol and a fatty acid (Ikechik, 2009, Glyceride breakdown section, para. 2)
A triglyceride is made up of a three carbon chain with five hydrogens and three hydroxyl groups. This is  glycerol.  There is also a hydrocarbon chain, or fatty acid (“Lipid molecules,” 2015). Digestion of triglycerides begins in the stomach. First, triglycerides are broken into the two components described above, glycerol and fatty acids. One triglyceride will be broken into 1 glycerol and 3 fatty acids during a hydrolytic reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme, lipase (Smith, 2015, Chemical metabolism section, para. 3). Next, the glycerol and fatty acid will move to the small intestine so that they can be absorbed into blood circulation. Griffin (2009) explains that the glycerol and fatty acid will pack together to form a chylomicron, whose role will be to transport the triglycerides to the liver. The liver will send the fats to the muscle cell for energy or the adipose fat cell for storage (p.1).  Fatty acids and glycerol are stored in adipose fat in complex forms, such as triglycerides until they are needed for metabolic processes. (Wolfe, E382)
The two components of the triglyceride take on different roles in metabolism. Although both have the potential to be stored as fat, Griffin (2009) explains that Glycerol is the only component of the triglyceride that has the ability to is be converted to glucose, while fatty acids are primarily stored as fat (p.1). The explanation for this becomes clear when studying how each component is metabolized.
Glycerol is first broken down into pyruvate. Once converted into pyruvate, it can undergo the anabolic process gluconeogenesis to synthesize glucose. It is important to recognize when this process would occur. This reaction occurs when an individual has a low blood glucose level, often caused by a lack of carbohydrates in the diet.  For this reason, it is important to have glycerol and fatty acid stores to ensure that metabolic processes can be maintained in times of fasting. (Physiol, 15)
On the other hand, the fatty acid component of the triglyceride will be broken down into acetyl CoA in a process called fatty acid oxidization. Griffin (2009) explains that this is the catabolic process in which fatty acids are broken down into acetyl CoA (p. 2-3). This process begins when coenzyme A binds to the end of a fatty acid chain. Next, coenzyme A will take two carbons from the fatty acid’s hydrocarbon chain and detach from the rest of the chain to form acetyl CoA and a shorter fatty acid. This process happens with the help of the coenzymes, FAD and NAD which are oxidized in the electron transport chain to FADH and NADH. After the fatty acid is broken down into acetyl CoA, it will enter into the Krebs cycle where it will produce ATP (Ross, 2014).

12.4 Citric Acid Cycle
[

Citric Acid Cycle Diagram
The citric acid cycle, also called the Krebs cycle, is the final stage of the oxidation of glucose. The carbon atoms enter the cycle as acetyl-CoA formed in the previous step (decarboxylation of pyruvate) and are oxidized in mitochondrial eight reactions to form various compounds such as CO2 and various hydrogens which are then captured by the NAD and FAD, produzind to three molecules of NADH and FADH2, and ATP release. These molecules formed during the Krebs cycle (NADH and FADH2) are acceptors H (receptors) intermediates of hydrogen which bind to protons (H +), released during the stages of metabolism of glucose, giving them for oxygen, which is acceptor (receiver) end of hydrogens.
After the Krebs cycle, molecules of NADH and FADH2 produced during all stages of metabolism of glucose, are transferred to the mitochondrial cristae, so that the electrons present in these molecules are transferred to oxygen, are the final electron receptor. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. The electrons are passed from molecule to molecule in cytochromes present in mitochondrial cristae. When the electron "jumps" from one cytochrome to another until you reach the end acceptor (oxygen), is the release of energy, which is converted into ATP.
The general formula of complete metabolization of glucose consists:
Glucose + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + 38ATP
After all the glucose metabolism (glycolysis by oxidative phosphorylation) for the formation of carbon dioxide, water and 38 ATP molecules.
This process is called cellular respiration, therefore the cell receives oxygen and sugar (in this case glucose) and releases energy in the form of ATP, carbon dioxide and water.
Citric acid cycle is a catabolic pathway for fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. It takes place in the inner compartment of the mitochondria, which is an important contribution for the final step in energy metabolism, the electron transport chain. When cells need energy, acetyl CoA (a 2 carbon compound), accesses the citric acid cycle. It is a continuous path since oxaloacetate (a 4 carbon compound) is needed in the first stage and is then synthesized in the final stage. However, the citric acid cycle does not regenerate acetyl CoA. Oxaloacetate has an important role in the citric acid cycle; enough has to be present for acetyl CoA to start its course. Whitney and Rolfes (2015).
A diet with sufficient carbohydrate ensures an ample supply of oxaloacetate, because in the previous steps of glycolysis, glucose produces pyruvate.
Oxaloacetate is the first compound to enter the Krebs cycle. Oxaloacetate first picks up acetyl CoA, drops off two carbons as carbon dioxide and then returns as before to pick up another acetyl CoA. As compounds in the citric acid cycle lose a carbon to carbon dioxide, hydrogen atoms containing electrons are transported by coenzymes made from vitamin B (riboflavin and niacin) towards the electron transport chain. Every run of the citric acid cycle yields a total of eight electrons. Whitney and Rolfes (2015).
There are few molecules that can inhibit the citric acid cycle: fluoroacetate, arsenite, and malonate. Fluoroacetate combines with CoA and forms fluoroacetyl-CoA. Fluoroacetyl-CoA then combines with oxaloacetate to form fluorocitrate which hinders the function of aconitase, resulting in the accumulation of citrate. Arsenite inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (the enzyme complex that helps alpha-ketoglutarate become succinyl CoA) and malonate inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (the enzyme complex in the reaction of succinate to fumarate). Akram, M. (2014).
The citric acid cycle plays an important metabolic role in our bodies. The acetyl CoA produced from glucose oxidation regulates the oxidation of fatty acids. After the deamination of many amino acids, it results in intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle. First, fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl CoA that is then oxidized in the TCA cycle. Jin, Sherry, and Malloy (2013). Krebs cycle is one of the main catabolic pathways that living cells apply to oxidize simple sugar molecule obtained from food to water and carbon dioxide. In conjunction with supplying energy, this cycle also provides the intermediates needed for the synthesis of compounds like glucose, amino acids, etc. The citric acid cycle is considered amphibolic, due to its different metabolic roles aside from oxidation. It takes place in other pathways such as gluconeogenesis, deamination, transamination, and the synthesis of fatty acids. Akram, M. (2014).

Electron transport chain
Alcohol metabolism
The electron transport chain is one of the final stages of energy metabolism. It is an aerobic, or oxygen dependent, process of energy metabolism (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015). It is composed of mitochondrial enzymes, or carriers, that move electrons from one complex to the next, resulting in the production of ATP (“Electron Transport Chain Definition,” 2004). The electron transport chain gets the hydrogen ions (protons) and high energy electrons from the coenzymes NADH and FADH2 that are end products of Glycolysis, Lipolysis, The Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle, and the process of converting pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA. NADH and FADH2 act as electron donors which give up an electron, as well as their hydrogen ions (H+), to power the synthesis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) (Alberts et al., 2002; Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).
When the coenzyme approaches the inner membrane from the inside, it is oxidized and donates an electron to the electron carrier (“Electron Transport Chain,” 2007). When the molecule is oxidized, a hydrogen ion that is removed from the molecule can be dissociated into proton and electron, allowing them to be passed separately through the chain. The electron carrier then picks up a H+ which is then passed to the outside compartment of the mitochondria as the electron moves to the next carrier. The passing of electrons through the carriers provides energy that is used to create an electrochemical proton gradient which pumps the H+ across the inner membrane (Alberts et al., 2002). This process continues to happen until the electron reaches oxygen.
The oxygen then accepts the electron and combines with H+ from within the inner compartment to form water. This can be seen with the following equation:
2H
+
+ 2e
-
+
1
2
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}}
O
2
→ H
2
O
The reason that the electrons and hydrogen ions are not donated directly from NADH and FADH2 to the oxygen molecules is because there would be too much of a free energy drop where the reaction would release nearly all of the energy as heat. To prevent this, the cells gradually move the electrons across electron carriers in the inner membrane. By having the production of water be more gradual, more of the energy can be stored rather than released into the environment as heat (Alberts et al., 2002).
With the inner concentration of H+ decreasing with the formation of H2O, the H+ ions in the outer compartment are then pumped through an ATP Synthase complex (Whitney & Rolfes, 2015).. The H+ ions are moving from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration (“Electron Transport Chain,” 2007). This process powers the synthesis of ATP as it adds energy to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphate group (Pi), a process that is called phosphorylation. This is represented by the formula below:
ADP + P
i
→ ATP
The energy in creating these bonds is then captured and the ATP leaves the mitochondria to go to the cytoplasm, where the energy is then used. The electron transport chain produces the most ATP out of all of the steps in energy metabolism with a net production of 32 (“Glycolysis, Krebs Cycle, and other Energy-Releasing Pathways,” n.d.). NADH produces more ATP as each NADH contains more energy than each FADH2. Due to the lower energy, FADH2 does not contribute to electrochemical proton gradient as much as NADH does and therefore does not cause as many hydrogen ions to be pumped across the gradient as NADH does. Both of these coenzymes, however contribute to the production of the 32 ATP produced by the electron transport chain (“Electron Transport Chain,” n.d.).
The electron transport chain (ETC) is found within the mitochondria of living cells, more specifically between the inner mitochondrial membrane and the mitochondrial matrix. The goal of the ETC is to produce and electrochemical membrane potential which in turn drives the formation of ATP. To achieve a membrane potential the mitochondria is built with membrane channel pumps, which include 4 complexes. The first three complexes in the series take on the job of facilitating redox reactions and moving positively charged H+ ions into the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH that is produced in Glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and in the formation of acetyl-CoA are used as electron carries and in essence fuel the ETC (Powers and Howley, 2015). Considered the chemiosmosis hypothesis, what happens next is simply to achieve oxidative phosphorylation. Redox reactions, that are spontaneously driven by Gibbs free energy, begin to occur along the ETC transferring electrons from electron donors (NADH and FADH) to electron acceptors (O2). Hydrogen ions accepted by O2 to form water as other positively charge H+ ions flow into the intermembrane space of the mitochondrial. Along with the movement of positively charged ions into the intermembrane space and the neutralization of H+ ions in the formation of H2O comes the establishing of a difference in charge between the matrix of the mitochondria and the innermembrane. Typically because of this difference in membrane potential, when giving the opportunity to establish neutrality, H+ ions will flush back into the mitochondrial matrix and this is harnessed as energy for the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP (Chen, 1988).
The ETC is the largest and most efficient source of ATP and the main source of ATP for aerobic exercises or activities. It can only run in the presence of Oxygen because of the role that O2 takes on in the redox reactions that occur in the ETC complexes. The first 3 complexes of the ETC have one purpose and that’s to drive redox reactions and move H+ ions into the innermembrane. Although the three pumps share the same purpose they don’t quite share the same efficiency and processing. For every transport molecule of NADH the mitochondria can synthesis 2.5 molecules of ATP while FADH only allows for the synthesis of 1.5 ATP, this is specifically do to where each of the transport molecules begin their journey in the ETC. NADH starts reactions in complex 1 which moves 4 hydrogen ions into the innermembrane yet FADH skips completely over complex 1 and starts its journey in complex 2. In general one molecule of ATP can be synthesized from the energy released from 4 hydrogen ions as the move down the electrochemical gradient that’s established between the mitochondrial matrix and the inner membrane. The first pump flushes 4 H+ ions, the second pump 4 as well and the final pump 2 H+ ions. Following the 3rd pumps is a transmembrane channel that allows the flow of H+ ions into the mitochondrial matrix and couples the energy released from this with ATP synthase (Miles, 2003).
Proton Transport with Respect to the Electron Transport Chain
Protons are known for their movement across membranes. They travel across a protein pump which is found inside a lipid bilayer. Protein transport coincides with respect to the electron transport chain. A molecule will become reduced by obtaining an electron; with that it will bring along its negative charge. In order to neutralize the charge, a proton is added due to its positive charge. The net effect is to move the whole Hydrogen atom, H+ + e- . Protons are easily transferred due to the fact that electrons are transferred through a membrane using the electron transport chain. The carriers are strategically placed so when it picks up a proton from one side of the membrane it can accept an electron and release the proton onto the other side of the membrane. The cycle continues until all of the protons are transferred across the membrane by the electrons (Alberts, 2002).
The diagram above represents the electron carrier B grabbing a hydrogen molecule on one side of the membrane and transferring it to electron carrier C. As electron carrier B receives the electron (e-) from A, the proton was released as the electron was received by electron carrier C.
Proton motive force is the total amount of energy that is created and gained by the electron carriers. There are only three electron carriers that are able to transport proteins across a membrane. When an area becomes condensed with protons, the intermembrane is created allowing protons to move from a high to low concentration. ADP is turned into ATP by phosphorylation (“Electron Transport Chain”, 2013). Peter Mitchell was the founder of a process called chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis was the process of the electron transport pumps carrying protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the inner matrix to an inner space which would create a high hydrogen concentration gradient. They found this yielded electrical potential and pH potential across membranes (“Electron Transport- Energy of Cell”).
Electron Carriers
As discussed, it takes electron carriers in order to move a particle across a membrane when dealing with the electron transport membrane. What are these electron carriers exactly?  There are eight of them. They include: NADH- ubiquinone oxidioreductase, succinate- ubiquinone oxidioreductase, ubiquinone/ ubiquinol, ubiquinol- cytochrome c oxidioreductase, cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase, electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), and glycerol-3- phosphate dehydrogenase. The significance of the electron transport chain is that each electron carrier has a higher standard reduction rate than the carrier located before it. The standard reduction potential is the capability of donating or receiving an electron (“Electron Transport Chain”, 2013).

12.6 Alcohol metabolism
[
]
Alcohol
Alcohol known as ethyl alcohol or ethanol is produced by the fermentation of different substances like yeast, starches, and sugar (Alcohol). This intoxicating substance is found in many different beverages like wine, liquor, and beer. This substance can be absorbed from two organs the stomach and small intestine and directly absorb into the bloodstream, affecting the central nervous system (Alcohol).
Introduction to Alcohol Metabolism
The majority of the alcohol one consumes, about 92-98%, is metabolized by the human body; the other 2-8% is lost through other bodily functions like “urine, sweat, or breath” (HAMS: Harm Reduction for Alcohol). There are two primary pathways in which alcohol can be metabolized:
The most significant pathway, which metabolizes the majority of ethanol in the liver, is initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (HAMS: Harm Reduction for Alcohol). This system is responsible for breaking down small amounts of alcohol. ADH oxidizes ethanol into Acetaldehyde, a toxin that contributes to the damaging effects of alcohol. Once it is converted, Acetaldehyde enters the mitochondria and is oxidized into acetate (King, 2015). The second pathway of ethanol metabolism is known as the Microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). The activity of this oxidizing system increases with the excess consumption of alcohol and unlike the ADH system, requires energy (HAMS: Harm Reduction for Alcohol).
An In-depth look at Alcohol Metabolism
[
]
As mentioned above, the process of oxidative alcohol metabolism can be broken down into four essential steps. These steps are the digestion and absorption of ethyl alcohol, the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde, further oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate, and the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from acetate.
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s 2007 publication, there are three main routes for the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetate. The first and primary route oxidative route involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. This enzymatic reaction occurs in the cytosol of hepatic cells and involves the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetate with a simultaneous reduction of a Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide  (NAD+) by two electrons to its reduced form (NADH).  The second route of ethyl alcohol oxidation involves the enzyme catalase, which is located in cell bodies called peroxisomes. In this enzymatic reaction, catalase stimulates the oxidation of ethyl alcohol via a reduction reaction with a hydrogen peroxide molecule (H2O2) to two water molecules (H2O).  This once again ultimately yields acetaldehyde. While this pathway facilitates only a small minority of alcohol metabolism, some research suggests that the pathway becomes more preferential when the patient is in a fasted state (Zakhari, 206). The third and final known route of ethyl alcohol oxidation is the Microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). Microsomes are nano sized heterogeneous vesicles that form from components of a cell’s endoplasmic reticulum ("Cellular Component - Microsome," n.d.). These microsomes, or vesicles, contain cytochrome P450 enzymes that assist in the oxidation of ethyl alcohol, especially in patients with a history of chronic alcohol consumption. Cytochrome P450 enzymes work in an energy dependent reaction where an oxygen molecule acts as the electron acceptor, reducing the ethyl alcohol molecule, and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate molecule acts as a reducing agent.
All of the mentioned reactions above contribute solely to the second step of alcohol metabolism, the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde. According to Zakhari’s 2006 publication, acetaldehyde is a highly toxic and reactive molecule that is believed to be not only a carcinogen, but also may contribute to the addictivity of alcohol consumption. As such, it is of vital importance to quickly oxidize the acetaldehyde molecule to a less toxic acetate molecule. This process is almost entirely governed by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which is located in the mitochondria of cells. This enzyme utilizes NAD+ as an oxidizing agent of acetaldehyde to form acetate. It is important to note that there is also an aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 enzyme that is active in the cytosol, however the metabolic activity of this enzyme is extremely small in relation to ALDH2 (Zakhari, 2006).
The final step in the metabolism of ethyl alcohol involves the transformation of acetate into a metabolically useful molecule. This is accomplished by converting acetate into acetyl CoA via the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase. Acetyl CoA is a molecule may now go on to perform a number of metabolic activities, such as enter the Krebs cycle, or be used for lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis (Zakhari, 2006).
Physiological Differences that can Affect Metabolism
Food- The amount and type of food one has in the Gastrointestinal System (GI tract) can affect the absorption of ethanol. The rate of absorption depends on the stomach and how quickly it can void it contents into the small intestine. This means that the more food one has in his or her stomach will slow the digestion and absorption of this “intoxicating” substance, diminishing its effects (Factors Influencing Alcohol Absorption and Metabolism, 2000).
Gender- Women and men metabolize alcohol differently. Women have less body water and lower amounts of active ADH. This increases the amount of alcohol ingested and absorbed by the blood stream, causing women to be more susceptible to alcohols affects (Factors Influencing Alcohol Absorption and Metabolism, 2000).
Adverse Effects of Excess Alcohol Consumption
[
]
Depending on the state of the Individual and rate of consumption, alcohol can have short term and long term effects.
Some short term effects are: “slurred speech, drowsiness, vomiting, breathing difficulties, impaired judgement, decreased perception and coordination, blackouts, and unconsciousness (Short- & Long-Term Effects of Alcohol).
If alcohol is consumed in large amounts, known as binge drinking, it can cause long term effects, including: “unintentional injuries such as a car crash, family problems, high blood pressure, liver disease, and cancer” (Short- & Long-Term Effects of Alcohol).
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
[
]
One of the lasting effects of alcohol consumption is known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This occurs when a woman drinks alcohol during pregnancy. Children affected by this can suffer from physical, behavioral, and learning disabilities (Factors about FASDs, 2015). Some include: “abnormal facial features, small head size, low body weight, poor coordination, difficulty with attention, learning disabilities, vision or hearing problems, and problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones” (Factors about FASDs, 2015).

Alcohol Overview
[
]
The term alcohol actually refers to a group of organic compounds containing a hydroxyl (OH) group. In laymen’s terms, alcohol refers to ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, the byproduct of fermentation, a process in which yeast consumes sugars to produce CO2 and ethanol (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). When describing alcohol, it is mostly considered to be the intoxicating ingredient in beer, wine, and liquor. Because ethanol is less toxic than other alcohols, and because of the effects it causes, people consume it to obtain those effects. Therefore alcohol is classified as a drug, a substance that modifies bodily functions.
Absorption of Alcohol in the Body
[
]
As soon as alcohol enters the body it is immediately absorbed. Unlike foods, which require time in order to break down and absorb nutrients, the effects of alcohol can be felt immediately. Alcohol dehydrogenase begins the breakdown of alcohol in the stomach. It is then passed quickly through the small intestine where absorption takes place before most other nutrients to ensure quick disposal. From the small intestine, the capillaries carry alcohol to every cell in the liver, where most of the absorption takes place (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016). While in the liver, alcohol is metabolized by two enzymes: Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), as in the stomach, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ADH first metabolizes alcohol into acetaldehyde and then further metabolizes it into acetate. Acetate is then metabolized into water and carbon dioxide in tissues other than the liver and eliminated from the body (US Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2007).
Effects of Alcohol
[
]
According the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (n.d.), alcohol affects multiple organs in the body including the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. In the brain, alcohol can affect the how the brain works and looks, leading to irrational behavior and the inability to coordinate movement easily and think clearly. Excess alcohol consumption has been shown to affect the heart, both over time and on single occasions, by causing cardiomyopathy (stretching and drooping of heart muscle), arrythimias, stroke, and high blood pressure. Because the liver is the site of most alcohol absorption, the affects of drinking weigh heavily on the liver. Excess drinking can lead to steatosis (fatty liver), alcohol hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. The pancreas creates a toxic substance that can lead to pancreatitis because of alcohol consumption. Finally, alcohol consumption, even on a single occasion, can weaken the body’s immune system, making it more susceptible to diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, n.d.).

12.6.1 Health Ramifications of Alcohol Use
[
]
Individuals all across the globe have become accustomed to drinking alcohol. To some it is a regular, casual activity, while others only partake in the consumption to celebrate special occasions. The subject is controversial, but there are studies that suggest a moderate daily intake of alcohol promotes cardiovascular health. In detail the daily recommended alcohol intake for women is one drink as to men to being two drinks per day (One drink = Beer: 12oz; Wine: 5 ounces; Hard Liquor: 1.5). Alcohol is metabolized in the body primarily through the liver; additionally alcohol can also be metabolized through the stomach, brain, and pancreas. Therefore, consumption of alcohol beyond the daily recommendation increases one’s risk of developing life-altering diseases, simply because alcohol interacts with the human body through various routes.
Short Term Effect
[
]
The tolerance of consuming alcohol varies differently each person. In essence, gender, age, body weight, and how fast their body metabolizes alcohol are different factors as to how fast alcohol can affect an individual (What is Moderation, n.d.). Some short-term effects of alcohol can consist of: vomiting, slurred speech, impaired judgment, headaches, distorted vision and hearing, decrease in motor skills, and blackouts (Short- & Long-Term Effects of Alcohol, n.d.). As mentioned before, these different short-term effects vary to each person’s gender and physical condition.
Long Term Effect
[
]
When one indulges in too much alcohol, they increase their risk of developing effects (both long-term and permanent). Depending on the gender, physicality, and genetic background of the person, each person will have different reactions to over consumption of alcohol. Some of the various unfortunate long-term effects are cancer of mouth or throat, cardiovascular disease, liver, disease, nervous system, pancreatitis, and birth defect.
Cancer
[
]
Excessive alcohol drinking can contribute to the development to different harmful cancers. The various risk of cancers can include the mouth, throat, colon, liver, even rectum, and breast (Alcohol Alert, 2007). However, the consumption of alcohol is not directly correlated to the development of cancer; diagnosis does not become inherent, the risks are just increased.
When alcohol is consumed in the body, its converted into a toxic chemical called acetaldehyde (Alcohol Alert, 2007). This chemical can be a stimulant to the formation of cancer because acetaldehyde can cause the interruption the cells repairing a damaged DNA (How alcohol causes cancer, 2015). Additionally, acetaldehyde causes liver cells to regenerate faster than normal; this can lead to cell alternation that can be a promoter to cancer.
Liver Disease
[
]
As the liver accounts for being the main source for alcohol to be metabolized, this places the liver in a vulnerable position to being harmfully effected due to its high exposure. Fatty liver is a type of liver disease that’s commonly attained by over consumption of alcohol, which in fact over 90% of regular drinkers develops this type of disease (Alcohol Alert, 2007).
Pancreatitis
[
]
Alcohol metabolism also occurs in the pancreas, which can dangerously expose it to high levels of toxicity byproducts of acetaldehyde (Alcohol Alert, 2007). Like other diseases, overconsumption of alcohol isn’t the only factor to the cause of pancreatitis, but more in addition to dietary habits, smoking, genetic background of how alcohol is metabolized, and the routinely patterns of alcohol intake (Alcohol Alert, 2007).
Birth Defects
[
]
Women who are pregnant are highly recommended not to consume alcohol. For example, women who consumes alcohol during pregnancy are likely to be exposed to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, also known as FADS. All of the toxic chemicals from when the alcohol enters the body to when its been metabolized to acetaldehyde, will cause birth defects. For example, highly exposing the fetus to alcohol can prevent the fetus from receiving essential nutrients through the placenta (Alcohol Alert, 2007). Babies, who are born with FADS, are prone to reach conditions of mental impairment, physical abnormalities, and behavioral problems (What is Moderation, n.d.).

Energy expenditure
Body composition
13.1 Energy Expenditure
Physical Activity
The most variable component of energy expenditure is physical activity since it is dictated by intentional lifestyle choices involving skeletal muscle action and the body systems that support these actions.  Ranging from 5-40% of daily energy expenditure, this percentage will remain in the lower end of the spectrum for those with sedentary jobs who incorporate little physical activity and at the higher end of the spectrum for those who have physically strenuous jobs and use their leisure time to exercise (Powers, Scott K.; Howley, Edward T.; 2015). Estimating the amount of energy expended during physical activity relies on two categories: body composition, specifically muscle mass and body weight, and the nature of the activity (Whitney, Ellie; Rolfes, Sharon Rady; 2016).  Skeletal muscles must produce more force and the body must work harder, or produce more power (Watts per unit of time) and consequently expend more energy in order to move an individual with greater total body weight (Schoeller, Dale A., 2009). Furthermore, several epidemiological studies comparing body weight and physical activity have concluded that body fat is more equally distributed in those who are consistently active (Rising R et al., 1994).  This indicates that exercise can engage the whole body to expend energy and more equally distribute macronutrients to produce energy for skeletal muscles and contributing body systems. The other body systems, including the nervous system, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and pulmonary system, are all highly involved in regulating and supporting skeletal muscle activity.  These systems need energy to transmit sensory information and motor responses via electrical impulses, inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide, deliver oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle cells, and initiate fatigue in order to protect other body systems from damage or visceral failure (Schoeller, Dale A., 2009).  Additionally, not only does energy expenditure depend on the duration, frequency, and intensity of the activity, but the type of macronutrients the body uses for energy also depend on these factors (Whitney, Ellie; Rolfes, Sharon Rady; 2016).  When energy expenditure is expressed in term of kilocalories, body weight and the type of activity are used to calculate the number of kcalories expended per minute for a given bout of exercise. Thus, the longer, the more intense, and the more frequent the physical activity, the greater the energy expenditure.
Research Spotlight: Energy Expenditure via Exercise and Weight Loss
In terms of weight loss, a study by Ross et al. concluded that among all of the components of energy expenditure exercise made up only a modest fraction of the entire energy deficit, indicating that diet contributes more to weight loss than exercise (2003).

Energy Expenditure Regarding Basal Metabolic Rate
People expend energy throughout the day while participating in physical activities as well as just resting. Energy is expended for one’s basal metabolism, ability to participate in physical activities, and even to consume food (Whitney & Rolfs, 2013). In this section we will discuss how energy expenditure is related to one’s basal metabolic rate (BMR).
	The basal metabolic rate is the rate at which the body expends energy for activities that support the body and are necessary for one’s survival (Whitney & Rolfs, 2013). One’s BMR represents the energy needed to carry out fundamental metabolic functions such as breathing, ion transport, maintaining the normal turnover of enzymes, etc. (Baggott, 2008). Approximately two-thirds of the energy one expends in a day goes towards one’s basal metabolism. One’s BMR also supports functions like the heart beating and the kidneys filtering wastes (Whitney & Rolfs, 2013).
	Basal metabolic rate can also be defined as the minimum rate of energy expended in an awake, relaxed person, lying on a bed in a thermoneutral environment after an overnight fast (Ravussin & Bogardus, 1989). Each person has a specific basal metabolic rate. BMR is typically measured with the subject in a fasted state sitting or lying quietly in a room with a comfortable temperature. It is often expressed in terms of surface area, kJ m-2 hr-1, which allows for a fair comparison among infants, adults, those who are lean, and those who are obese (Baggott, 2008).
	Basal metabolic rate is variable between the sexes and also varies with age. BMR is highest in people who are growing such as children and pregnant women (Whitney & Rolfs, 2013). One’s BMR peaks in the infancy stage and declines rapidly through one’s childhood and adolescent years. Lean body mass is a major determinant of one’s BMR. Women tend to have more body fat and less lean muscle mass compared to men; thus, women tend to have a lower BMR than those of comparable men. With increasing age, one’s BMR starts to fall slowly. This decline is largely due to the loss of muscle. The loss of muscle is not inevitable and is often caused by absolute or relative inactivity. Weight-bearing exercises can help prevent some muscle loss among the elderly (Baggott, 2008). Additionally, BMR is high in those who have a fever, are under stress, or have highly active thyroid glands. One-way to increase one’s BMR is to participate in endurance and strength-training activities regularly in order to maximize lean body mass (Whitney & Rolfs, 2013). It has also been found that one’s fat-free mass and fat mass are also significant contributors to one’s BMR (Johnstone, Murison, Duncan, Rance, & Speakman, 2005).
	Because BMR accounts for 60-80% of one’s daily energy expenditure small deficits or excess in BMR can add up to a large number of calories over time. Weight gain tends to occur with aging and the age-related decrease in basal metabolic rate has been accounted for by a change in one’s body composition (Ravussin & Bogardus, 1989). Along the same note, from a nutritional standpoint, decreased caloric requirements can lead to decreased food intake, and a lower calorie intake can lead to a deficiency of essential nutrients (Baggott, 2008). Overall it is important to note that one’s basal metabolic rate is very important in everyday life, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important to keeping one’s basal metabolic rate in an ideal range.

Adaptive Thermogenesis
Adaptive thermogenesis is the change in basal metabolic rate of the body to compensate for the adjustment of energy expenditure based on changes in the environment, such as diet, trauma, stress, and extreme weather. The human body shows a stronger opposition to weight loss than to weight gain (Hill, Peters, & Wyatt, 2012). This is why weight is very hard to keep off after it is lost. This theory is studied frequently when looking at the topic of obesity amongst individuals. When an obese individual restricts their kilocalorie intake significantly for an extended period of time, their body tends to adapt to the diet change and eventually the individual will come to find that it is much more difficult to keep losing weight. When food intake and body weight decrease, there is a decline in metabolic rate as well. After about three or four weeks the body will adapt to the new kilocalorie intake, and the individual will stop losing weight even though they are still on the lower kilocalorie diet (Muller & Bosy-Westphal, 2013). This theory is also commonly referred to as a “weight-loss plateau”. The human body uses extra energy to adapt to new outside conditions and this can greatly change the energy expended in an individual, but only in extreme cases. This is why the energy from adaptive thermogenesis is not included when estimating energy requirements for most healthy individuals.
Resting Metabolic Rate
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is the measure of energy expended in a relaxed state, similar to Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). However, RMR is measured with requirements that aren’t as strict as BMR, such as a lack of a specific requirement of recent food intake and physical activity of the day before. Because of this, RMR values are typically higher than BMR values for the same individual. The RMR depends on a wide-range of factors, such as Age, Height, Growth, Body Composition, Dietary intake, and other outside factors that change how much energy is expended in a day. While some studies have shown that RMR is significantly increased with exercise and strength training, other studies have not come to the same conclusion (Speakman & Selman, 2003). The varying outcome is potentially related to the time at which the RMR is measured and the less-strict RMR measurement requirements. There are two main ways to measure RMR or how many calories a person burns in a given day. One method is called indirect calorimetry. This uses respiratory gases to determine the volume of oxygen uptake and volume of carbon dioxide output to then be put into the Weir Equation. The other method, which tends to be less accurate, is to use an RMR formula that uses height, weight, and age to calculate an individual’s RMR, but some of these formulas have been proven to give values up to 1000 kilocalories off of the actual value (Kelly, 2012).

Thermic Effect of Food
The thermic effect on food is the energy your body uses to digest, and process the macronutrients you eat through absorption, transportation, storage and your metabolism. This used to be known as the Specific Dynamic Action. Everything you eat will give you calories that are burned through digestion and increase your metabolism. This process happens about 2 hours after you eat a meal. This type of energy expenditure accounts for about 10% of the total calories you ingest (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013).  The amount varies, however, with the different types of macronutrients.
Carbohydrates have a thermic effect of food of 5-30%.
Proteins have a thermic effect of food of 30%.
Fats have a thermic effect of food of 0-5% (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013).
This amount can also vary with how much food you eat at once and the types of food you eat. Eating large loads of food versus eating smaller, more frequent meals has an effect on thermic effect of food. Meals with more calories have a higher thermic effect of food than smaller meals (Castillo, P., Tai, M., & Pi-Sunyer, F., 1991). Some people may think they can lose weight by eating less but that is not the case. Not eating will, in turn, slow down your metabolism and keep you from your goal. Eating more will burn more fat, as long as you’re eating the right things. This means eating foods that have a greater thermic effect of food.
People of different body compositions also have different thermic effects of food. Swaminathan, R., King, R., Holmfield, J., Siwek, R., Baker, M., & Wales, J. (1985) found that obese people have a lower thermic effect of food for fats and for a meal in whole than lean people do. This means that lean people will burn off their calories faster than heavy set people. Another study done by Segal, K., Gutin, B., Nyman, A., & Pi-Sunyer, F. (1985) stated that the thermic effect on food was higher for the people who were lean versus the people who were obese. All the participants that were compared had the same body mass but differing body composition.
It has also been proven that exercise increases the effects of thermic effect on food after your workout (Segal et all., 1985). The food will be used as energy and to restore your muscles rather than stored as fat. This also agrees with what is stated above because it is most common for people who work out to be leaner than people who are sedentary.

Energy Expenditure: Basal Metabolic Rate
Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimal rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest. (Pike, Brown, 1975).  Metabolism is all of the internal and external processes that the body needs to do for proper function. Some of the processes that the body carries out constantly without rest are breathing, blood flow, body temperature control, and the binding of myosin and actin filaments for muscle contraction. When the body generates heats from metabolism, it is called thermo genesis. The amount of heat generated from the body can be measured to estimate energy expenditure.
There are a few trends that are associated with basal metabolism. First off, as you increase in age, your basal metabolic rate goes decreases. "This is associated with a decrease in muscle mass, which normally decreases metabolic rate as well."(Saltin, Gollnick, 1983).  When comparing two different people of the same age, the person with more lean muscle mass will be have a higher basal metabolic rate. They have more muscles; so that puts a larger demand on the body to circulate blood faster, increase the rate of gas exchange for respiration, and there is more force exerted when muscles contract.
Of the body's total energy expenditure, 70% comes from basal metabolic processes from various organ systems in the body. 20% came from physical activity and the last 10% came from thermo genesis. Thermo genesis is defined as the digestion of food.  Intake of oxygen and coenzymes are necessary to have all of the body processes work properly for survival. Carbon dioxide needs to be expelled through the Krebs cycle as well. In a general breakdown of the organs that account for energy expenditure, the liver accounts for 27%. This has the highest percentage of energy expenditure because the liver takes part in many different metabolic processes. Next the brain accounts for 19% because it is the control center of the body and is responsible for almost every action in the body. Skeletal muscles account for 18% of energy expenditure and is responsible for the contraction of muscles during movement. The kidneys account for 10% of energy expenditure and are responsible for the excretion of urine. The heart is responsible for 7% of the expenditure of energy because it has the task of pumping blood throughout the whole body. And other organs account for 19% collectively. (Thorstensson, 1976 )
	The primary organ responsible for the regulation of metabolism is the hypothalamus. Its functions include control of the autonomic nervous system, production of certain hostile feelings, and regulating the body temperature and food intake as well.

Body Composition Makeup and Measuring
The Center for Medical Weight Loss (

), offers a comparison between body weight and body composition.  Body weight includes fat, lean body mass, and water.  Lean body mass includes muscle, organs, and bone.  A standard bathroom scale measures body weight.  Body composition refers to the distribution of both muscle and fat in the body.  This is often represented as a two part system which includes both lean body and fat weight.   A body composition scale provides the user with not only their weight but also the percentage of fat their body contains.
TopEndSports (

, the article written by Jeanie Lerche Davis starts by discussing the old methods such as using measuring tapes and the BMI method.  It then goes on to grade the newer methods on a scale from A to F on whether or not the tests do anything to help a person understand body composition; ease and accuracy of methods; and cost.
13.2.2 Body Composition and Health
[

Defining Body Composition and Related Measures
[
]
While the cultural ideal in Western countries focuses much on body composition and its effect on appearance, it is important to remember that body composition is an important indicator of health. Body composition is the ratio of water, lean muscle mass, and fat mass in the body – it is often expressed in terms of percentage body-fat. One related measure for health is body mass index (BMI). BMI is a calculated measure of weight relative to height and there is an established range of BMI values that predict healthy weight.By looking at a BMI chart which has ranges for what values of BMI constitute a person as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese, a person can clearly see which category he or she falls under. Although this method of body weight measurement provides a general idea of how a person’s weight compares to standards, it doesn’t take into account the proportion of lean mass to fat mass as do body composition measurements.
Differences Between Body Composition and BMI Measurements
[
]
There are undoubtedly differences between body composition and BMI; however, BMI may be used to estimate body composition and both measures provide valuable health information for the general population. The underlying premise of body composition and BMI measurements is to evaluate how much body-fat one has, and to then predict if that amount of fat puts one at risk for certain diseases. Body composition may be a more accurate measure for disease risk because it shows how much actual body-fat a person has. On the other hand, BMI does not directly measure body-fat, but uses the relationship between one’s weight and height to more or less predict body-fat. Thus, a problem with BMI arises when measuring individuals with lots of lean muscle mass. Active individuals or athletes might have low and healthy percentages of body-fat, but are categorized as overweight or obese by BMI standards. Clearly, the body-fat percentages of these muscular athletes are not putting them at risk for diseases related to obesity. On a similar note, BMI might be a poor choice of measurement when looking at older adults. As individuals age, their height and weight can remain stable, and their BMI values will stay the same. However, older adults are likely to experience sarcopenia and have decreased amounts of lean muscle while their body-fat percentage increases– this alters their body composition and increases disease risk even though their weight and BMI remains constant (Baumgartner, 2006).
As previously mentioned, body composition is the ratio of the mass of fat in the body relative to the ratio of fat-free mass or lean mass. Fat-free mass in the body includes mass from bones, water, and muscle. One of the key factors in body composition is body density which is the overall density of the body which can be calculated by adding four individual densities including the density of water, density of fat, density of mineral, and the density of protein. These four components as well as their proportions in the body contribute to body composition and help to determine overall body health. By taking into account factors such as the proportion of lean mass in the body, body composition provides a more accurate depiction of the health of a person when compared to solely measuring the weight of a person and comparing it to his or her height as in BMI.
	Breaking down a person’s overall mass into components can create a better picture of whether or not a person who is determined “overweight” by their BMI is actually “overweight” or rather is “overfat”. An example of a person who is overweight but not overfat is an athlete who has a high proportion of lean mass that may contribute to a higher number on the scale but not a decreased level of health. A person that is overfat, on the other hand, has a higher proportion of mass from fat which can reflect a decreased level of health. In addition, there are other factors that can contribute to a person being “overweight” such as race. African Americans tend to have higher bone densities than whites which can cause a larger BMI even if the proportion of lean mass to fat mass is equivalent to that of a person of a different race.
Body Composition and Disease Risk
[
]
Large percentages of body-fat and the areas of the body where that fat is stored have an effect on the health of an individual. More specifically, visceral fat in the upper-body places individuals at risk for metabolic and heart diseases, cancer, and more (Britton et al., 2013). Men generally have more visceral fat around the abdomen than women. However, both men and women face health risks when they have significant abdominal fat. And in the United States, the number of women with significant abdominal fat has grown more quickly than the number of men who have similar fat deposits (Ford et al., 2004). Women tend to store more fat in the lower body. This fat is also known as subcutaneous fat and poses less risk for heart disease than visceral fat (Karastergiou et al., 2012). Nonetheless, it is clear that maintaining a healthy body composition without excess fat can lower obesity related disease risks.
Body Composition Conclusion
[
]
In the end, body composition provides a relatively accurate method in assessing body health and can be helpful in making a person aware of possible disease risks or health issues associated with a high fat mass. It can also help athletes or people looking to gain a higher lean mass percentage keep track of where they stand rather than just looking at a scale and trying to determine whether any weight gained or lost was due to lean or fat mass.  No matter how a person measures his or her body health, exercising and eating a balanced diet are the two main ingredients, and following these two lifestyle choices will result in endless benefits reflected in body composition and overall state of health.

Weight Management and Body Image
The concept of weight management is important to keep control of so that the body can achieve and maintain good health.  In today’s society, people have created an ideal sense of beauty and body image that is difficult to maintain (Office on Women’s Health, 2009).  Women are especially prone to feeling dissatisfied with their body image and feel pressured to stay thin.  Comparisons of body weight, family and friend influence, environmental changes, food availability, and doctoral advice all affect body image (Office on Women’s Health, 2009).  Various shapes and sizes can form a healthy body, but exercise, rest, and nutritious food items must be part of the daily routine (Physical Activity, 2015).
Introduction
Weight is the essential aspect that people need to stay keenly aware of (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  Weight management is defined as the conservation of a healthy body range by preventing gradual weight gains and weight losses over time (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  Weight management requires constant maintenance, and even with an ideal body weight, good health may not accompany it (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  In order to also have good health, a nutritious diet and high physical activity level must be apparent as well.  Weight gains and losses occur at different rates, but do indeed deal with energy balance intake.  Strategies to achieve a healthy body weight include realistic goals, proper food intake, good levels of physical activity, an encouraging atmosphere, and optimistic behavior (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  Whether underweight or overweight, health problems can reside.
Weight Loss Strategies
To control weight, one must also maintain their eating patterns, physical activity, environment, and psychological mindset.  Strategies to control body weight and engage in weight loss are as follows:
1)	Realistic Goals:  To lose weight, one must understand that in order for a difference to be seen in their body and health, changes need to be made to their lifestyle.  It’s not going to be an easy task nor is it going to be quick process.  A reasonable weight loss goal and mindset pursuit needs to be set at the beginning of the venture (Food and Nutrition Information Center, 2015).
2)	Eating Patterns:  Adequate caloric intake is required to provide the body with the proper nutrients and energy for survival (Food and Nutrition Information Center, 2015).  Eating breakfast, portion control, slow meal consumption, drinking water, fiber, low dense meals, selective fats, and carbohydrate consumption must be watched carefully. (Library of Medicine, 2015)
3)	Physical Activity:  Moderate exercise that includes 200 minutes of physical activity a week is essential for the body to lose weight (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  Exercising supports lean muscle tissue, balance, and strength.  Physical activity affects the body’s metabolism by speeding it up and suppressing appetite to healthy food intake.  Glucose and fatty acids become extremely evident in the blood and also reduces stress (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).
a.	According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, adults need at least two hours and thirty minutes of moderate-intense aerobic activity every week.  Two of these days require muscle-strengthening activities (Physical Activity, 2015).
b.	Aerobic activities include cardiovascular exercises raise heart rate, cause heavy breathing, and induce sweat.
4)	Environmental Influences:  The surrounding atmosphere can greatly influence one’s eating patterns.  Social interactions cause people to eat more due to the comfort or conversational distractions that interfere with portion control (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  Remember to limit food intake when around various flavors of foods, use small plates, and do not leave food easily accessible after finishing a meal (Food and Nutrition Information Center, 2015).
5)	Psychological Mindset:  Behavioral patterns need to be practiced and repeated in order for the mind to learn healthy eating and activity factors (Rolfes, Whitney, 14 ed).  The cognitive ability to find a problem and treat it with appropriate habits will support a weight loss routine.
Results'
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) assess children up from ages 2 to 19 (Division of Nutrition, BMI, 2015).  A Body Mass Index Percentile Calculator is used to measure the body mass index of children, teens, and adults.  Although a high BMI can indicate a high amount of body fat, it does not mean that a person is overweight (Division of Nutrition, BMI, 2015).  As previously mentioned, various shapes and sizes of bodies are formed due to food consumption, natural body growth, and lifestyle.
•	Underweight: less than 5% body fat
•	Normal weight: 5-85% body fat
•	Overweight: 85-95% body fat
•	Obese: 95% and over body fat

13.3.2 Overweight and Obesity
[
]
'
What Is Obesity?'
Obesity is an excess proportion of total body fat. A person is considered obese when his or her weight is 20% or more above normal weight. The most common measure of obesity is the body mass index or BMI. A person is considered overweight if his or her BMI is between 25 and 29.9; a person is considered obese if his or her BMI is over 30.
"Morbid obesity"
means that a person is either 50%-100% over normal weight, more than 100 pounds over normal weight, has a BMI of 40 or higher, or is sufficiently overweight to severely interfere with health or normal function.
Measuring obesity
The most common method of measuring obesity is calculating an individual’s Body Mass Index (BMI). This is calculated by dividing a person’s weight measurement (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in metres).
In adults, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 means that person is considered to be
overweight
, and a BMI of 30 or above means that person is considered to be obese.
In children and adolescents, BMI varies with age and sex, so the BMI score for children and adolescents is related to the UK 1990 BMI growth reference charts in order to determine a child’s weight status.
BMI is the best way we have to measure the prevalence of obesity at the population level. No specialised equipment is needed and therefore it is easy to measure accurately and consistently across large populations. BMI is also widely used around the world, which enables comparisons between countries, regions and population sub-groups.
For most people, their BMI correlates well with their level of body fat. However, certain factors such as fitness and ethnic origin can sometimes alter the relationship between BMI and body fatness. So then other measurements such as waist circumference and skin fold thickness can also be collected to confirm an individual person’s weight status.
When to Seek Help for Obesity
You should call your doctor if you are having emotional or psychological issues related to your obesity, need help losing weight, or if you fall into either of the following categories.
If your BMI is 30 or greater, you're considered obese. You should talk to your doctor about losing weight since you are at high risk of having health problems.
If you have an "apple shape"—a so-called, "potbelly" or "spare tire"—you carry more fat in and around your abdominal organs. Fat deposited primarily around your middle increases your risk of many of the serious conditions associated with obesity. Women's waist measurement should fall below 35 inches. Men's should be less than 40 inches. If you have a large waist circumference, talk to your doctor about how you can lose weight.
10.3.2.1 Global statistics
[
]
The prevalence of obesity in England has more than tripled in the last 25 years.
The latest Health Survey for England (HSE) data shows that in England in 2010:
62.8% of adults (aged 16 or over) were overweight or obese
30.3% of children (aged 2–15) were overweight or obese
26.1% of all adults and 16% of all children were obese
Foresight’s Tackling Obesities: Future Choices report, published in October 2007, predicted that if no action was taken, 60% of men, 50% of women and 25% of children in Britain would be obese by 2050. Recently reported modelling suggests that without action 41-48% of men and 35-43% of women could be obese by 2030.
10.3.2.2 Causes
Obesity occurs when a person consumes more calories than he or she burns. For many people this boils down to eating too much and exercising too little. But there are other factors that also play a role in obesity. These may include:
Age.
As you get older, your body's ability to metabolize food slows down and you do not require as many calories to maintain your weight. This is why people note that they eat the same and do the same activities as they did when they were 20 years old, but at age 40, gain weight.
Gender.
Women tend to be more overweight than men. Men have a higher resting metabolic rate (meaning they burn more energy at rest) than women, so men require more calories to maintain their body weight. Additionally, when women become postmenopausal, their metabolic rate decreases. That is partly why many women gain weight after menopause.
Genetics.
Obesity (and thinness) tends to run in families. In a study of adults who were adopted as children, researchers found that participating adult weights were closer to their biological parents' weights than their adoptive parents'. The environment provided by the adoptive family apparently had less influence on the development of obesity than the person's genetic makeup. In fact, if your biological mother is heavy as an adult, there is approximately a 75% chance that you will be heavy. If your biological mother is thin, there is also a 75% chance that you will be thin. Nevertheless, people who feel that their genes have doomed them to a lifetime of obesity should take heart. Many people genetically predisposed to obesity do not become obese or are able to lose weight and keep it off.
Environmental factors.
Although genes are an important factor in many cases of obesity, a person's environment also plays a significant role. Environmental factors include lifestyle behaviors such as what a person eats and how active he or she is.
Physical activity.
Active individuals require more calories than less active ones to maintain their weight. Additionally, physical activity tends to decrease appetite in obese individuals while increasing the body's ability to preferentially metabolize fat as an energy source. Much of the increase in obesity in the last 20 years is thought to have resulted from the decreased level of daily physical activity.
Psychological factors.
Psychological factors also influence eating habits and obesity. Many people eat in response to negative emotions such as boredom, sadness, or anger. People who have difficulty with weight management may be facing more emotional and psychological issues; about 30% of people who seek treatment for serious weight problems have difficulties with binge eating. During a binge-eating episode, people eat large amounts of food while feeling they can't control how much they are eating.
Illness.
Although not as common as many believe, there are some illnesses that can cause obesity. These include hormone problems such as hypothyroidism (poorly acting thyroid slows metabolism), depression, and some rare diseases of the brain that can lead to overeating.
Medication.
Certain drugs, such as steroids and some antidepressants, may cause excessive weight gain.
Health risks
Being obese or overweight brings significant risks at a range of different points throughout life. The health risks for adults are stark. We know that, compared with a healthy weight man, an obese man is:
five times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes
three times more likely to develop cancer of the colon
more than two and a half times more likely to develop high blood pressure – a major risk factor for stroke and heart disease
An obese woman, compared with a healthy weight woman, is:
almost 13 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes
more than four times more likely to develop high blood pressure
more than three times more likely to have a heart attack
Obesity and overweight pose a major risk for serious diet-related chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and certain forms of cancer. The health consequences range from increased risk of premature death, to serious chronic conditions that reduce the overall quality of life.
For the USA:
of 22     industrialized countries, the U.S. has the highest obesity statistics
2/3 of     Americans over age 20 are overweight
nearly     1/3 of Americans over age 20 are obese
Overweight and obesity lead to adverse metabolic effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin resistance.
The likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and hypertension rises steeply with increasing body fatness. Confined to older adults for most of the 20th century, this disease now affects obese children even before puberty. Approximately 85% of people with diabetes are type 2, and of these, 90% are obese or overweight.
Raised BMI also increases the risks of cancer of the breast, colon, prostate, endometroium, kidney and gallbladder.
Chronic overweight and obesity contribute significantly to osteoarthritis, a major cause of disability in adults. Although obesity should be considered a disease in its own right, it is also one of the key risk factors for other chronic diseases together with smoking, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.
According to the American Cancer Society, obesity cost an estimated $75 billion in 2003 because of the long and expensive treatment for several of its complications. According to the National Institute of Health, $75-$125 billion is spent on indirect and direct costs due to obesity-related diseases.
Childhood overweight and obesity
Introduction
[
]
Children need a healthy, balanced diet that gives them enough energy to grow and develop. This means that children usually need to take in more energy than they use and this extra energy forms new tissues as they grow. However, if children regularly take in too much energy, this is stored as fat and they will put on excess weight.
1
Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. The prevalence has increased at an alarming rate. Globally, in 2010 the number of overweight children under the age of five, is estimated to be over 42 million. Close to 35 million of these are living in developing countries.
2
Many factors, including genetics, environment, metabolism, lifestyle, and eating habits, are believed to play a role in the development of obesity. However, more than 90% of cases are idiopathic; less than 10% are associated with hormonal or genetic causes.
3
Overweight and Obesity
[
]
Overweight and obesity are defined as
abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health
.2
Operational definitions of obesity in adults are derived from statistical data that analyze the association between body mass and the risk of acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. Because acute medical complications of obesity are less common in children and adolescents than in adults, and because longitudinal data on the relation between childhood weight and adult morbidity and mortality are more difficult to interpret, no single definition of obesity in childhood and adolescence has gained universal approval.
Some investigators have used the terms overweight, obese, and morbidly obese to refer to children and adolescents whose weights exceed those expected for heights by 20%, 50%, and 80-100%, respectively. The body mass index (BMI) has not been consistently used or validated in children younger than 2 years. Because weight varies in a continuous rather than a stepwise fashion, the use of these arbitrary criteria is problematic and may be misleading.
3
A few extra pounds does not suggest obesity.  However they may indicate a tendency to gain weight easily and a need for changes in diet and/or exercise.  Generally, a child is not considered obese until the weight is at least 10 percent higher than what is recommended for their height and body type.  Obesity most commonly begins between the ages of 5 and 6, or during adolescence.  Studies have shown that a child who is obese between the ages of 10 and 13 has an 80 percent chance of becoming an obese adult.
4
Measuring overweight and obesity
[
]
It is difficult to develop one simple index for the measurement of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents because their bodies undergo a number of physiological changes as they grow. Depending on the age, different methods to measure a body's healthy weight are available.
2
Using Body Mass Index (BMI) to Estimate Overweight and Obesity
[
]
The BMI is the tool most commonly used to estimate overweight and obesity in children and adults. The BMI is a continuous, although imperfect, measure of body fatness. Calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2).The BMI is used because, for most people, it correlates with the amount of fat in their bodies.
Children grow at different rates at different times, so it is not always easy to tell if a child is overweight. The BMI correlates closely with total body fat (TBF), which is estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning in children who are overweight and obese.
Normal values for BMI vary with age, sex, and pubertal status, and standard curves representing the 5th through the 95th percentiles for BMI in childhood and adolescence were generated using data from the 1988-1994 NHANES.

5

Special charts, called BMI centile charts, have been developed to show whether children are under or overweight for their age. These charts compare a child’s BMI against other children of the same sex and age.
Tool E4
-This tool contains detailed information on the measurement and assessment of overweight and obesity in children. It provides information on how to measure overweight and obesity using Body Mass Index (BMI) and growth reference charts; provides information on measuring waist circumference; and provides details on how to assess overweight and obesity in children. BMI charts are provided at the end of this tool for girls and boys. This tool is consistent with NICE guidance and also Department of Health recommendations. It is for all healthcare professionals measuring and assessing overweight and obese children.

Treatment
[
]
There are multiple factors that can contribute to a person being overweight or obese. These issues accumulate and worsen over time until an individual is considered overweight or obese. Factors considered when identifying problem areas that could use improvement are:
Poor diet choices
Inaccurate food portion sizes
Lack of moderate physical activity
Living a sedentary lifestyle
Treatment for a person who is overweight or obese can be a long and difficult journey, and it is extremely important to do so in a manner that is safe and healthy. The most impactful way of succeeding in losing weight in a healthy way is by setting goals, making changes in lifestyle and by doing the process gradually (“How Are Overweight,” 2012).
Pre-packaged meal plans can be a helpful tool for health care professionals to educate a patient about proper portion sizes. Making sure the patient understands the correct amount of which foods they should be eating is critical. Pre-packaged meal plans are also beneficial in assisting the patient later in the process when they are ready to transition back to self-cooked meals and make the long-term commitment to change their lifestyle regarding food. With the support and guidance that the pre-packaged meal plans provide, many individuals can see weight loss results of 50 pounds or greater in around 18–24 weeks (“Physician-Supervised,” 2015).
In addition to being properly educated and monitored regarding eating habits, a patient must also make lifestyle changes with their physical activity. Many overweight or obese people do not partake in much exercise, and a large factor of weight loss and living healthy is physical activity. The patient should be adding physical activity to their daily life by beginning small and gradually increasing as they progress through their weight loss journey. Adding too much exercise too quickly can be problematic, so a gradual approach is more likely to be successful. The staff at Mayo Clinic suggests that the most simple methods of increasing a patient’s activity level is for them to keep moving throughout the day as well as getting around 150–300 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2015). Both of these are crucial parts of the behavioral change that can help in treating overweight or obesity. By becoming more active, patients will see progress in their treatment more noticeably than if they remain inactive and continue to live a sedentary lifestyle.
Over an extended amount of time, as the patient progresses through the incremental goals they have set for themselves, they will see greater changes in their physical appearance and health. Once the patient passes the threshold of no longer being considered overweight or obese by a medical professional, the patient’s treatment can be considered complete. They have succeeded in making major alterations to their former lifestyle that will continue to be used to maintain a healthy weight.

Causes for Obesity
[
]
The causes of obesity are complex and include genetic, biological, behavioral and cultural factors.  Obesity occurs when a person eats more calories than the body burns up.  If one parent is obese, there is a 50 percent chance that their children will also be obese.  However, when both parents are obese, their children have an 80 percent chance of being obese.  Although certain medical disorders can cause obesity, less than 1 percent of all obesity is caused by physical problems.  Obesity in childhood and adolescence can be related to:
poor eating habits
overeating
lack of exercise (i.e., couch potato kids)
family history of obesity
medical illnesses (endocrine, neurological problems)
medications (steroids, some psychiatric medications)
stressful life events or changes (separations, divorce, moves, deaths and abuse)
family and peer problems
low self-esteem
depression or other emotional problems
4
WHO recognizes that the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity results from changes in society. Childhood obesity is mainly associated with unhealthy eating and low levels of physical activity, but the problem is linked not only to children's behaviour but also, increasingly, to social and economic development and policies in the areas of agriculture, transport, urban planning, the environment, food processing, distribution and marketing, as well as education.
The problem is societal and therefore it demands a population-based multisectoral, multi-disciplinary, and culturally relevant approach.
Unlike most adults, children and adolescents cannot choose the environment in which they live or the food they eat. They also have a limited ability to understand the long-term consequences of their behaviour. They therefore require special attention when fighting the obesity epidemic.

Consequences of childhood obesity
[
]
Health risks now
[
]
Childhood obesity can have a harmful effect on the body in a variety of ways. Obese children are more likely to have–
High blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In one study, 70% of obese children had at least one CVD risk factor, and 39% had two or more.
Increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
Breathing problems, such as sleep apnea, and asthma.
Joint problems and musculoskeletal discomfort.
Fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastro-esophageal reflux (i.e., heartburn).
Obese children and adolescents have a greater risk of social and psychological problems, such as discrimination and poor self-esteem, which can continue into adulthood.
Health risks later
[
]
Obese children are more likely to become obese adults.  Adult obesity is associated with a number of serious health conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.
If children are overweight, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.

Prevention of obesity in children
[
]
Overweight and obesity, as well as related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. It is recognized that prevention is the most feasible option for curbing the childhood obesity epidemic since current treatment practices are largely aimed at bringing the problem under control rather than effecting a cure. The goal in fighting the childhood obesity epidemic is to achieve an energy balance which can be maintained throughout the individual's life-span.
Note: CC is adding strategies for weight management.
General recommendations
[
]
increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts;
limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats;
limit the intake of sugars; and
be physically active - accumulate at least 60 minutes of regular, moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity each day that is developmentally appropriate.
Societal Recommendations
[
]
Curbing the childhood obesity epidemic requires sustained political commitment and the collaboration of many public and private stakeholders.
Governments, International Partners, Civil Society, NGO's and the Private Sector have vital roles to play in shaping healthy environments and making healthier diet options for children and adolescents affordable, and easily accessible. It is therefore WHO's objective to mobilize these partners and engage them in implementing the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health.
WHO supports the designation, the implementation, the monitoring and the leadership of actions. A multisectoral approach is essential for sustained progress: it mobilizes the combined energy, resources and expertise of all global stakeholders involved.
2
Population-based approaches to childhood obesity prevention
- The document published by WHO, aims to provide Member States with an overview of the types of childhood obesity prevention interventions that can be undertaken at national, sub-national and local levels. The document first outlines guiding principles for the development of a population-based childhood obesity prevention strategy and then describes the approaches for population-based obesity prevention. There is a broad range of population-level actions that governments can take to prevent childhood obesity. A comprehensive childhood obesity prevention strategy will incorporate aspects of each of the key components.

INTERVENTIONS IN WEIGHT MANAGEMENT  IN CASES OF OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT
Interventions in weight management  in cases of obesity and overweight
Section 10.3.3.1 Energy and Body composition  Weight management  Interventions
Abstract
A small percentage of obesity cases may be caused by genetic and endocrine reasons, but the large majority of cases of obesity are caused by environment reasons (socio-economic environment, inappropriate diet and lack of physical activity). The intervention has to be individual and normally consist in changing lifestyle (better nutrition, increase physical activity and when required for obesity type II and III the prescription of medicine and/or surgery).

Interventions in weight management  in cases of obesity and overweight
Introduction
A small percentage of obesity cases may be caused by genetic and endocrine reasons, but the large majority of cases of obesity are caused by environment reasons (inappropriate diet and lack of physical activity).
Therefore the treatment of obesity has to be individual and customized for a given patient.
In order to perform an appropriate intervention it is necessary to know the factors which have contributed to the obesity in a particular individual.
It is easier and cheaper to prevent the pandemic obesity than to treat the pandemic obesity, once it has been established.
The intervention has to be individual and normally consist in changing lifestyle (better nutrition, increase physical activity and when required for obesity type II and III the prescription of medicine and/or the bariatric surgery, bypass, etc.).
Influence of genetic endowment
The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are not yet well understood.
A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes-susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI).
To identify common variants influencing body mass index (BMI), the study have analyzed genome-wide association data from 16,876 individuals of European descent.
The main results have confirmed the BMI association in 60,352 adults (per-allele effect = 0.05 Z-score units; P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and 5,988 children aged 7–11 (0.13 Z-score units; P = 1.5 x 10(-8)). In case-control analyses (n = 10,583), the odds for severe childhood obesity reached 1.30 (P = 8.0 x 10(-11)) (1)
Other studies have shown as well that In European general populations, the combined effects of common polymorphisms in FTO and MC4R are therefore additive, predictive of obesity and T2D, and may be influenced by interactions with physical activity levels and gender, respectively (2)
Common MC4R variants contribute to variation in BMI and obesity risk in the general population.
Of particular interest is the finding from genome-wide association studies that suggests that the region downstream of MC4R contributes to its regulation (3)
According to the findings of a recent study, people who have a mutation in the gene APOA2 (which regulates a component of HDL or good cholesterol) have a higher risk of obesity if they have a diet rich in saturated fats.
The CC genotype was associated with a 6.8% greater BMI in those consuming a high (P = 0.018), but not a low (P = 0.316) saturated fat diet (4)
Complex interaction of factors contributing to obesity
The inappropriate diet or the lack of physical activity may be due to multiple causes:
·	Bad emotional control (stress, depression, anxiety, compulsory behaviour, etc.)
·	Poor socio-economic environment (emotional support, frequency of friends, marital status changes, and a Social Relationship)
·	Lack of education
·	Bad food choices
·	Eating abroad frequently
·	And so on
Bad emotional control (stress, depression, anxiety, compulsory behaviour, etc.)
An important factor in the failure to achieve a correct weight management are bad handling of emotions.
It is well known that our emotions have a powerful effect on our food choices and eating habits.
Found empirical evidence that the influence of emotions on eating behavior is stronger in obese than in non-obese and dieters in relation to people who do not practice rigid diets (1)
It has also been suggested that the emotion itself can not be responsible for excessive intake but rather, the real cause of overweight, how emotion is fronted by person (6,7)
Only by knowing the emotional factors one can reinforce healthy habits that allow us to control weight.
Therefore in emotional eaters to control overweight and obesity is recommended to follow cognitive therapy to control emotions better, a healthy diet and regular exercise practice.
In a longitudinal study of 6 months with 41 sedentary obese people which have lost an average of 8% of their weight and 41 physically active non-obese people.
The influence of emotions in their food intake was assesed by means of a questionnaire (Garaulet M., 2010) (8)
The most significant findings have been:
A lower BMI better emotional control intake.
The higher the emotional score, less amount of weight lost.
Women have been more influenced by their emotions than men.
The weight control strategy was sedentary people use diets. Instead cyclists do by controlling the amount of exercise they do.
Psycological factors:
According to research conducted at the University Hospital Infanta Leonor de Madrid, obese people are not allways happy.
According to results presented by the XVI congress of psquiatry 2012 in Bilbao, Spain  (10)
·	31% of obese patients had presented an anxiety disorder associated with obesity
·	35% had a history of a depressive disorder.
·	17% of obese people "have a history of having anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa
·	10% revealed having had a disorder in impulse control
·	The report also shows a high prevalence of attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among patients analyzed: ·       20.4% of patients had ADHD, a figure five times higher than expected in the general population
·	In addition, 62% of the patients reported regular dieting 15% had tried dieting organized more than 5 times throughout his life.
Choosing a healthy Diet to prevent and to reverse obesity
The inappropriate diet or the lack of control of the energy balance are the main contributors to obesity.
For instance beverages, cakes and sugar consumption is contributing greatly to world obesity.
The appropriate diet has to be healthy, complete in food groups, palatable and  easy to flollow, otherways it will be abandonned sooner or later.
The MD has demonstrated to be a good choice; as well as other diets followed by Japonneese, vegetarian people, and so on.
The Mediterranean diet is rich in nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fibre, omega-3 fatty acids (from fish) and monounsaturated fatty acids (from olive oil), whose beneficial effects on health have been widely demonstrated (11)
These studies show as well the progressive abandonment of the MD and the gradual progress of cardiovascular diseases and chronic diseases in the world ; particularly in countries like China, India, Mexico and Arab countries.
The most critical point is the pandemia of childhood obesity (11,12)
A logitudinal study which included 6319 participans within thr SUN Project have demonstrated that adherence to Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with weight gain (13)
Another logitudinal study which included 11 015 participants with 4 years of follow-up in the SUN Project have demonstrated  a significant direct association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and all the physical and most mental health domains (vitality, social functioning and role emotional) (14)
Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher scoring for self-perceived health according to cross-sectional survey made in Catalonia Spain, among a random sample of the 35-74-year-old population (3910 men and 4285 women) in 2000 and 2005  (15.)
Choosing a meals distribution and timing
Another factor to be taken into account  in therapeutic strategies should incorporate not macronutrient distribution in addition to the caloric intake.
Five meals distributed along the day are recommended.
The time clock is as well important and is influenced by the CLOCK gene polymorphism.
Late lunch eaters lost less weight and displayed a slower weight-loss rate during the 20 weeks of treatment than early eaters (5 vs. 12% weight loss respectively).
Late eaters were more evening types, had less energetic breakfasts and skipped breakfast more frequently that early eaters.
CLOCK rs4580704 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with the timing of the main meal with a higher frequency of minor allele (C) carriers among the late eaters  (Garaulet M., P Gómez-Abellán, J J Alburquerque-Béjar, Y-C Lee, J M Ordovás and F A J L Scheer (2013) (16)
Choosing a program of physical activity to prevent and to reverse obesity
There are a great variety of physical activity  programs which could be used in weight management, it is essential to perform aerobic exercise as well a strength and  stretching exercises.
The program has to have on a weekly basis at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (the ones preferred by one: walking, bicycling, swimming, etc), or at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or the combination of both.
Experts have found that participating in high intensity interval workouts are more successful at losing body fat.
These intensity sessions put you at higher risk for injury and burnout.
High intensity exercise is possible if you are fit, if it is not yet the case you need a training program  that on a weekly basis increments the duration and intensity of tour physical activity.
High intensity exercise also requires low intensity recovery time in the days following the session. This is where careful exercise programming comes into play.
It is important to engage in sport teams in our locality. This will prevent the abandon of the exercise program.
The benefits of physical exercise in the prevention of overweight and obesity are well documented.
Regular physical activity reduces heart diseases , certain types of cancer and also helps maintain healthy body weight (17,18).
The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (19) , suggests incorporating a minimum weekly total of two and a half hours of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, spread over at least five days of the week.
Exercising five or more hours per week is recommended for weight loss.
The calories burned during exercise depends on each individual anthropometrical parameters (gender, weight,  physical conditions, fitness, etc.).
We have to set our goals of intensity and duration of the exercise on a weekly basis and when a goal has been met, we have to choose a higher goal.
It is interesting to focus on the fact that exercising and eating certain foods, like olive oil and foods rich in fiber, are useful to control the appetite. Therefore we have to use foods low dense on energy after exercising to facilitate weight management.
A recent study with nine female runners and ten walkers completed a 60 min moderate-intensity (70% VO2max) run or walk, or 60 min rest The runners often consumed fewer calories than they burned during the run (20). Other studies suggests as well that long- and short-acting signals interact to alter hypothalamic sensitivity to satiation signals (21) which could influence eating behaviour following exercise of moderate intensity.
Study case: Longitudinal study of six months of intervention in obese people
Some of this information has been published in article Nutr Hosp. 2012;27(6):2148-2150
Introduction
The influence of emotions on the intake is stronger in sedentary, obese dieters.
Objective
To study the influence of emotions on the food intake of sedentary and physically active people. To study weight control strategies used by those persons.
Methods
We have performed a longitudinal observational study of weight loss with dietary intervention of 6 months in Madrid Pharmacies. 41 sedentary people and 41 physically active people have participated.
The emotional score was obtained by questionnaire "emotional eater" (Garaulet M., 2010) (22).
The score can be classified as: Dining little emotional (0-10 points); Moderately emotional (11-20points), very emotional. (21-30points).
Results
Anthropometrical data
Sedentary people
Age = 53.9 ± 12.4 years, BMI = 33.6 ± 4.9 kg/m2. N=10 men and 31 women. Weight 87.5 ± 14.5 Kg.
Weight loss was significant (10.2% kg in 6 months)
The emotional eater score were as average= 13.2 ± 4.4 points over 30 points for sedentary people (13.1 points in men and 13.4 points in women).
In cyclists emotional eater score were as average = 7.1 ± 3.7, they were significantly less emotional eaters than sedentary people (p <0.001).
The most influential emotional factors were: Cravings and intake of excessive food in men. Binge eating and Obsession for food in women
Little emotional eaters have lost more weight than very emotional eaters (12% vs 8%, respectively.). Correlation coefficient = -0.39.
Active people
Age = 49.9 ± 10.4 years, BMI = 23.1 ± 2.1 kg/m2. N=41 men. Weight 70.5 ± 10.5 Kg.

Conclusion
The intervention based on hypo-caloric diet and increasing physical exercise by sedentary people was effective.
The higher was the emotional score, the lower was the amount of weight lost and higher value of the BMI
The very emotional eaters have lost less weight than low emotional eaters.
The weight management strategy of sedentary people was recurrent dieting.
By the contrary the cyclists weight management strategy was controlling duration and intensity of physical exercise.
Medications
[
]
There are a number of medications that can be prescribed that help maintain weight. Although some of these are available over-the-counter, it is highly important that you contact your doctor before beginning a new regiment. All of the following medications should not be taken if pregnant or breast-feeding, as there can be serious effects on the child. You should inform your doctor if you have any heart conditions, or if you have had any alcohol or drug addictions in the past. Medication is only expected to work when used in conjunction with proper diet and exercise.
Orlistat: works by blocking the body’s absorption of fat. The medication can be either prescribed by a doctor (Xenical) or bought over-the-counter at a pharmacy (Alli). The pill is taken with each meal that contains fat. There are some complications that may occur. Taking Orlistat means your body may not be able to absorb fat-soluble vitamins, so a supplement may be suggested by a physician. The pill should be taken either during a meal, or up to one hour after a meal.
23
24
Belviq: generic Lorcaserin, works by curbing your appetite. Most often, it is used in patients who are considered obese, and usually also have high cholesterol, diabetes, or a higher than normal blood pressure. One dose, generally one pill at 10 mg, is taken twice a day, or as prescribed by a doctor. Complications have been seen in those who are also taking antidepression medications.
25
Contrave: generic Bupropion and Naltrexone, curb the appetite as well as lessen the impact of addiction on the body. The ideal patient for Contrave is someone who is considered obese. Burpropion is an antidepressant, which can cause a decrease in appetite. It is important to distinguish that while it can be given to cease nicotine addictions, it should not be used to treat of psychiatric conditions. Contrave has been known to cause problems when taken with high-fat meals, especially in those with epilepsy.
26
Phentermine: an appetite suppressant, usually taken before you eat breakfast. It has been known to cause sleep disruption, as it affects the central nervous system, so it should be taken no later than 6 pm. This is the only medication listed that is only taken for a short-term medication, not to be taken for 3+ months like the others.
27
As with taking any medications, it is important to take the proper dosage. Contact medical services if you suspect you have taken more than the prescribed amount, or call the American Association of Poison Control Centers: 1-(800)-222-1222

When people think of fitness, they think of the ability to be able to participate in physical activities such as running, swimming, or playing sports with their friends and peers. From a more scientific standpoint, fitness includes much more than just being able to go out and run around. Fitness includes nutritional health, such as getting enough vitamins and minerals from your diet, a healthy body composition, stronger bones and immune system, and cardiorespiratory health. Being fit can help lower the risks a person has of developing a multitude of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, certain types of cancer, and even lower the risks of someone suffering from severe anxiety and depression, and help improve a person's longevity. In older adults, physical activity has even been seen to lead to better cognitive function (Office of Disease Prevention, 2015)
To many, fitness is known as being able to be engaged in physical activities, without causing injury or distress to yourself. Physical activity, along with a healthy diet, is the safest way to lose weight, and improve your overall health, and help lower your risk of obesity (President's Council on Fitness)
Many Americans of today cannot be classified as physically fit.  Two categories of fitness exist – health-related fitness and athletic-related fitness.  Athletic-related fitness consists of much more demanding and sport-specific requirements.  The health-related fitness components are for the general public (and are the focus of the rest of this section).  It consists of muscle strength and endurance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness (Surgeon General, 1996).  These components can be attained through physical activity, or “bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above the basal level,” as defined by the Surgeon General (1996).
The American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate cardiorespiratory activity per week (30 minutes, 5 days per week), or 75 minutes of vigorous cardiorespiratory activity per week (25 minutes, 3 days per week).  In addition to cardiorespiratory activity, one should engage in moderate to intense muscle building activities as well as flexibility exercises at least twice a week (American Heart Association, 2015).
Cardiorespiratory exercises consist of large muscle groups contracting repeatedly and rhythmically, and include exercises such as running, walking, elliptical, and climbing stairs.  Note that “vigorous” and “moderate” can vary from person to person.  Some beginners might find that a slow jog can raise their heart rate a significant amount and thus consider this activity vigorous, while more physically fit individuals would classify jogging as moderate.  As fitness levels improve, some exercise's classifications can change from vigorous to moderate as the body grows stronger.  Muscles can be exercised by lifting weights (machine or free), resistance training, or body weight exercises such as pushups and sit-ups.  Muscular training sessions can be either full body or split body (i.e. arms and back one day, abs and legs the next).  The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 2-4 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise, with a 48-72 hour rest period between sessions. Flexibility can be attained through static or ballistic (stretching while moving) stretches, or other practices such as yoga or Pilates.  Hold the pose or stretch for 10–30 seconds, and repeat it 2-4 times (ACSM, 2011).
The most noticeable effects of exercise include improvements in the cardiovascular and muscular systems, as well as improved immune, endocrine, and metabolic function.  Regular, moderate exercise can reduce the risk of multiple diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes.  However, it is important to note that the benefits of exercise diminish in two weeks and can completely disappear in as little as 2 months (Surgeon General, 1996).  Thus, consistency could be considered one of the most essential components to not only achieving physical fitness, but also maintaining it.
14.1.1 Types of fitness
[
]
Fitness is typically described as the combination of a number of aspects of health that ultimately contribute to increasing healthiness in different parts of the body.
These aspects include:
Flexibility- the capacity of the joints to move through a full range of motion; the ability to bend and recover without injury (Understanding Nutrition, 2015). Physical activities that increase this freedom of movement are ones that promote the movement of joints, such as yoga, and a variety of stretches. (National Institute of Health, 2012)
Cardiorespiratory Endurance- most aerobic activities promote this aspect of fitness. Physical activities that promote cardiorespiratory endurance do so by increasing heart rate and breathing rate over a period of time, keeping your cardiac and respiratory systems in functioning at an optimal level. Exercises that increase your cardiorespiratory endurance are activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming, and other things that raise your heart and breathing rate. (NIH, 2012)
Muscle Strength and Endurance- a muscle's ability to perform a maximum contraction time after time while a single muscle's ability to perform sustained work (Conditioning, 2016). Strength and endurance exercises strengthen muscles by breaking apart and re-building muscle cells. These help to build and maintain muscle and bone mass. Activities that promote this are resistance training, such as weight lifting. (NIH, 2012)
Balance-the ability to control the body's position, either stationary or while moving (Conditioning, 2016). Balance exercises are typically needed by older adults who have a higher risk of falling. These activities help to strengthen the muscles specifically in the lower extremities that are involved in maintaining balance, including activities such as calf raises, and standing on one foot. (NIH, 2012)
Body Composition- though not a physical activity, body composition is an important part of fitness. It is the ratio of fat to lean tissue in your body, and we strive for more lean body tissues and less fat. It is important to recognize though, that fat is an important tissue in our body, and is essential to life, just not in excess.
Aerobic Endurance Training
Aerobic training or endurance training provides a multitude of benefits for the functioning and overall health of the body.
A few of the benefits include:
Boosts of High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol levels
Helps control blood pressure
Strengthens the bones in the spine
Helps maintain a healthy weight
Higher levels of energy
Stronger heart
Stronger immune system
Types of Aerobic Exercises
There are many different types of aerobic exercises that can be put into the categories of low intensity or high intensity. If the exercise is categorized as High Intensity, it is further defined as low impact or high impact. Examples of each include:
1.	Low to moderate impact exercises – Brisk walking, swimming, rowing, stationary bike riding, cross-country skiing.
a.	Who can take part in these exercises? Nearly anyone in a reasonable level of fitness should be able to take part in many of the low to moderate impact exercises. Brisk walking is a great alternative to running for people who cannot take the impact that running has on the body. Stationary biking is great cross-training for runners as it helps in increasing turnover and in keeping up cardiovascular endurance.
2.	High-impact exercises – Running, tennis, soccer, backpacking, biking, rollerblading
a.	Who should do these types of exercises? If you are in good physical health already, it is recommended to do high impact exercises no more than every other day. Those who are elderly, overweight, or out of good physical condition should rule out high impact exercises, until they get back into good physical condition.
A good way to incorporate aerobic exercises into you daily exercise routine would be to add a mix of low and high impact exercises. If you wish to see improvements in aerobic capacity, 3–4 hours per week of aerobic exercise is the ideal amount.
For healthy adults, the best approach to incorporating aerobic exercise is to start with a mix of low impact and high impact exercises. If maintaining a level of fitness is the goal, two weekly aerobic workouts are ideal. If you wish to increase aerobic capacity, three to five aerobic exercises will get you to where you want to be.
For out of shape or elderly people, it is best to slowly start incorporating aerobic exercises into your daily routine. For example, start out with 10–15 minutes of low impact aerobic exercise every other day, and gradually work up to 30 minutes and then 35–40 minutes and so one. As you can increase the time spent doing each sessions of aerobic activity, work towards a goal of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per day, anywhere from three to seven days each week.
A great way of gauging the aerobic intensity of an exercise session is trying to aim for a “conversational pace.” This type of pace is just enough to work up a sweat and still able to talk to a friend without gasping for breath when you are working out. As your level of fitness increases, your “conversational pace” will increase with it.
14.1.2 Recommendations
[
]
The recommendations for physical activity varies based on a wide variety of circumstances, such as age and weight. For adults aged 18 years of age to 64 years of age, a minimum of two and a half hours consisting of moderate-intensity activities is recommended for overall health. This can be substituted with an hour and a half of vigorous-intensity activities (Office of Disease Prevention, 2015). In addition to this, all major muscle groups should be worked out with muscle strengthening activities on at least two days per week. Even greater health benefits can be seen by increasing these recommendations.  (Center for Disease Control, 2008)
Moderate-intensity activity is considered as such when your heart rate is elevated to 50% to 70% of one's maximum heart rate. For a vigorous-intensity activity, the heart rate is elevated to 70% to 85% of a person's maximum heart rate (CDC, 2008). When it comes to each individual person though, one must go at their own pace, recognizing the cues of their body, and know how far they can push themselves without hurting themselves. When you begin to exercise, one should be very aware of their body, and listen to the cues of it. If you are not sure of how to start an exercise routine, or the best way to achieve your own personal fitness, make sure to contact your doctor and make a plan that is safe, but effective for you as an individual.
14.1.3 Fitness Progression
[
]
How do we know what changes to make in our routine in order to progress our fitness level and enhance our health through exercise? In order to answer this question we need to determine the difference between physical activity and exercise. Physical activity is any methodology of muscular activation that causes the body to use energy. Exercise is a planned subset of physical activity that has a set objective of building or maintaining physical fitness. In order to lead a healthy lifestyle, one must engage in planned exercise and know the tenants of exercise progression. This is vital to ensuring one is able to advance safely and sensibly in an exercise routine. Physical activity is also beneficial, but the most therapeutic effect to the body comes from planned exercise (Howley & Powers, 1996).
Progression in any health related exercise program must emphasize progressing from lighter activity to more intense activity slowly and steadily, without drastic changes. Recommended exercise programs include dynamic, multi muscle group activities such as jogging, rowing, cycling, dancing, and swimming. The effects of these programs is dependent on several factors: Frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercise sessions. When changing a program to advance to a higher level of exercise for physical fitness, it is important to focus on changing only one of these factors at a time to ensure safety and to ensure that the body adapts to the stress of exercise adequately (Howley & Powers, 1996).
Frequency - Improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness increase with the frequency of exercise sessions. The lowest number of sessions required for improvements of cardiorespiratory fitness is two (2). Improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness begin stagnating after three to four sessions per week. Depending on the desired results, one can substitute high intensity exercise at less frequency for moderate intensity exercises at high frequency (Howley & Powers, 1996).
Duration - Duration must be taken into account when analyzed in tandem with frequency. The total work accomplished per exercise session is paramount to determining the amount of calories burned weekly which must be factored into the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) of the exerciser (Howley & Powers, 1996).
Intensity - Intensity describes the total metabolic stress on the cardiovascular system which is crucial to bring about training adaptations. If intensity is not high enough, then the participant will not make optimum gains in cardiorespiratory fitness because the body is used to the demands being placed on it. Different ways of measuring intensity include the Borg rate of perceived exertion scale and target heart rate range (Howley & Powers, 1996).

14.2 Energy systems
[
]
14.2.1 Anaerobic
[
]
There are three main energy systems that occur in the human body in order for muscle cells to regenerate ATP during physical activity; anaerobic is one of them, and includes the lactic acid cycle. During this cycle glucose is broken down into pyruvate. The goal of this system is to produce ATP at a fast rate for high-intensity exercises; these exercises last anywhere from five seconds to two minutes (Whitney). Anaerobic translates to lack of oxygen. Examples of anaerobic exercises done during an anaerobic exercise test, by Dr. Henry Vandewalle, include force-velocity tests, vertical jump tests, staircase tests, and cycle ergometer tests. Maximal power was measured during this study to obtain information on anaerobic capacity. This fast power in muscles comes from muscle glycogen. During extreme activity intensity, the fuel source is ATP and creatine phosphate (CP); creatine phosphate becomes readily available through the phosphagen system (Whitney). If one were to do a 100-meter sprint, or swing a golf club or baseball bat, these would all be considered extreme activity intensity (Whitney). Extreme activity intensity does not last very long, only five to ten seconds. Very high activity on the other hand, requires ATP from carbohydrates, and not creatine phosphate. Examples of this activity contain a 400 meter sprint or a gymnastics routine; these high activity intensities last anywhere from twenty second to two minutes (Whitney). Overall, these exercises do not require oxygen to be supplied to the muscles, hence the definition of anaerobic-lack of oxygen.

14.2.2 CP-ATP
[
]
During an average day of work done by the body, the majority of force in the muscles is supplied through the Aerobic system, especially through the Krebs Cycle. However, for higher intensity forces applied by the muscles a different kind of structure is used, which is the anaerobic system. This can be broken down into two sub groups, ATP production through Phosphocreatine (PC) breakdown and formation of ATP via Glycolysis.  The simplest and fastest way of producing ATP in the body is through the PC system, which forms ATP through the addition of PC to ADP to produce ATP and creatine by the enzyme creatine kinase.  (Artiole 2012) During the onset of exercise, on any intensity, ATP is used to create the energy for these force production of the muscles. The muscles then immediately begin the creation of more ATP, starting with the PC system, which is the quickest to respond to the loss and use of ATP by the muscles. However, it is a very short-lived cycle. Due to the fact that there is only a limited supply of Phosphocreatine in the muscles, it can only produce so much ATP before the store runs out. Once the muscles are out of PC they will move on to the next cycles, first starting with Glycolysis. This PC system will be regenerated though, through the reformation of PC during a period of exercise recovery. (Powers & Howley, 2007) In athletics this system is needed for athletes who are competing at events which require a large amount of force production in a very short time span. Events such as a 100 meter dash, high jump, a max out for a weight lifter, and even  the sport of diving use almost 100% of the Anaerobic system to supply the ATP needed in the short time period to stress the muscles. (Baker 2010) Their event is done so quickly, the body can’t produce ATP fast enough through the other two systems, so it only uses ATP from the PC system. Because athletes are always looking for a way to be the best, one way to set you apart from the competition is adding more Phosphocreatine to the body in order to have a bigger supply in the muscles, which the PC system can draw from during the onset of exercise. By adding more you allow for a longer use of the PC system, allowing the muscles to be stronger and faster then with a limited supply. Phosphocreatine can be found in a variety of food sources, but the highest amount comes from red meat.

14.2.3 Lactate
[
]
The way in which lactic acid is broken down into energy helps to fuel our bodies to preform the necessary actions in our everyday lives. When we digest glucose, it is digested in our bodies through a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis is the basic metabolic breakdown of glucose to ATP, which provides our muscles energy. When this process is performed in an environment without oxygen, it produces lactate. (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013)
There are several specific steps in the chemical process to create lactate. It all starts when glucose is broken down by coenzymes into pyruvate and continues onto the electron transport chain. Since there is an absence of oxygen, the pyruvate will accept the extra hydrogen ions instead of proceeding on through the electron transport chain. Once the pyruvate accepts the hydrogen ions, it then becomes lactate. This process produces small amounts of ATP, but not as much as aerobic respiration creates. (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013) Anaerobic respiration is a less efficient way of producing energy, but it is faster then aerobic respiration. (Lactic Acid, 2015)
During intense, prolonged exercise, the muscles in our bodies need lots of energy. However, they become deprived of oxygen and build up with lactate as a result. This lactate cannot be broken down as quickly as it is being produced in our bodies. The small amount of ATP produced during this glycolysis temporarily provides the muscles with enough energy to continue their function until the oxygen levels return to normal. If this rigorous exercise continues, than the build-up of lactate can cause very sharp pains and muscle fatigue. Our muscle cells also become exposed to a low pH because the lactate is acidic. If the lactic acid is not removed from the muscles, than permanent muscle damage can occur. This is why an individual will start to breathe rapidly and heavily while participating in intensive exercise. It is our body’s natural response so it can provide enough oxygen to the muscles so lactate can be converted to aerobic respiration. (Anaerobic Pathways)
Another way in which lactate can be utilized is by circulating it from the muscles to the liver. The liver can transform this lactate back into glucose so that it can be used to refuel your muscles and glycolysis can occur again. This recycling process is called the Cori cycle, named after the scientist who first discovered it. The lactate must be transported to the liver because the muscles cells do not contain the necessary enzyme to initiate this process. (Whitney, E., & Rolfes, S., 2013)

14.2.4 Aerobic
[
]
The aerobic energy system consists of aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and the TCA cycle. Muscles in the human body depend on this aerobic system in order to receive ATP for muscle contractions to occur. Aerobic means that oxygen is present. When we consume carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, they are continuously oxidized through glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and TCA in order to provide ATP to the body (Whitney). Aerobic energy systems are needed to supply oxygen to the muscles for long-distance efforts such as running, swimming, or cycling. These are all activities that could last anywhere from three to twenty or more minutes (Whitney). Unlike anaerobic exercises, ATP is not immediately available, and there is no creatine phosphate involved. ATP is received from carbohydrates or fats. Aerobic exercise has multiple health benefits. According to a research study on aerobic exercise, “aerobic exercise reduces blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive persons. An increase in aerobic activity should be considered an important component of lifestyle modification for prevention and treatment of high blood pressure (Whelton).” That being said, it is important for ones health to incorporate daily exercise for at least twenty minutes to an hour every day.

14.3 Diet and Fitness
[
]
Diet and fitness work hand in hand meaning that in order to maximize the potential of one you must work on perfecting the other as well. Someone with a bad diet would not be able to achieve a ‘fit” or “in shape” body and conversely someone who trains hard and devotes a lot of time to training would be weak without a stable diet to support them. Currently the general trend of society is towards an un-fit lifestyle that consists of terrible eating habits and neglect towards key recommendations in regards to nutrient intakes. In order to have good fitness one needs to be physically active. Physical activity can produce long-term health benefits such as: reduce fat, lower risk of heart disease, strengthen bones, improve mental health, etc. (1, 2) In order to have the proper energy supply for physical activity, one needs to keep their diet in check. This means reaching all the proper recommended values of each nutrient for your body type and age. Eating at the correct times of day, this means eating before the times of increased physical activity. However, eating too much before you exercise can cause you to fee slow and sluggish. (3) Some simple suggestions in order to keep your diet and physical activity in sync would be to drink plenty of fluids, eat carbohydrates and protein to help your muscles recover, stray away from large meals and instead eat smaller meals more frequently. (3) One way to increase your physical activity and your overall fitness would be to make physical activity a part of your life. (2) This means to work in movement and activity into your everyday schedule. This could mean to take the stair instead of elevator, bike to your destination or even join a gym to take fitness classes. With this increased activity you will need to make sure that you are meeting your proper amount of kilocalories to supply energy to fulfill this activities. Always keep in mind that without the proper amount of calories, you will feel weak and unable to perform. This is different for everybody so in order to truly find out what is the correct balance of diet and activity you will have to test it out for yourself. Food choices dictate your overall health and well-being. Diet can determine how you feel at this moment and also in the future. A good diet will always go hand in hand with an optimal amount of physical activity or fitness.

14.3.1 Carbohydrate loading
[
]
Carbohydrate loading is a diet strategy that involves greatly increasing carbohydrate intake before high intensity physical activity. It was first developed in the late 1960s and was made up of a 3-4 day depletion phase followed by 3-4 day loading phase (RSM-AH, 2012). During the depletion phase the athlete would engage in hard training with very low carbohydrate intake. It was believed that this would stimulate the enzyme glucose synthase, but with further research it was discovered that the depletion phase is not required for carbohydrate loading to have its desired effect.
The current method of carbohydrate loading involves only part two, the loading phase. The loading phase involves a high carbohydrate diet of about 7-12g/kg of body weight and is usually done for a few days before a high intensity athletic event. The goal is to increase the body’s fuel storage in the muscles, and as a result improve athletic performance (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2013). Carbohydrate loading is usually coupled with reducing physical activity for 1–4 days and resting up for the high-intensity endurance athletic event.  As a result of the increased fuel storage, the athlete will have more energy and experience less fatigue during the completion of the high-intensity athletic event.
Carbohydrate loading is only necessary for moderate to high intensity endurance events that last more than 90 minutes. Marathon runners, endurance swimmers, long distance triathletes, cross-country skiers, and cyclists are the athletes that benefit the most from carbohydrate loading. Most other athletes do not need to do carbohydrate loading, as the body can use its existing energy storage for most recreational activity. For most other athletes as long as their diet is 50% or more carbohydrates, they will not need carbohydrate loading and can participate and excel in athletic events.
The most common mistakes made by athletes participating in carbohydrate loading can be attributed to not coupling it with an exercise taper, failing to eat enough carbohydrates, consuming too much fiber, fear of weight gain, and eating too many high fat foods. Since athletes are used to continuous training, they can find it difficult to cut back on training for 1–4 days. Carbohydrate loading requires athletes to reduce fiber intake to avoid digestive discomfort. During carbohydrate loading athletes can gain about 2 kg in body mass, an athlete’s fear of gaining excess weight can prevent them from doing carbohydrate loading properly (AIS). It is also important to make sure that carbohydrate loading is made up of high carbohydrate and low fat foods.
Some of the risks involved with carbohydrate loading are weight gain, blood sugar changes, and stomach upset. Therefore, athletes, especially diabetics, should consult with their physician before engaging in carbohydrate loading.

14.3.3 Micro-nutrient needs
[
]
Micronutrients consist of fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins, and trace minerals. Micronutrients are essential to our diets because they help with the transportation of oxygen and energy release during daily activities. During strenuous exercise, energy is turned over into the skeletal muscles meaning there is a greater need for micronutrients to provide more energy (Maughan, 1999). Athletes need their daily nutrients because of how much energy they expend during exercise. Many athletes believe the common myth that taking vitamin and mineral supplements before a competition will enhance their performance (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014). In reality, vitamin and minerals require a few days before they can function in helping the body’s energy. A typical athlete who eats nutrient-rich foods will gain all the necessary micronutrients in their diet. In Maughan’s article, he stated “Vitamin supplementation is generally unnecessary” (Maughan, 1999). Today researchers can agree that those who suffer from any deficiencies may take supplements to help with the deficiency but not to increase performance (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014). Further research about the benefits of taking supplements is still being performed today.
Water-Soluble Vitamins
Water-soluble vitamins are most involved in energy metabolism in the body (Maughan, 1999). Athletes should pay attention to their intake of water-soluble vitamins in order to have a proper amount of energy. Important water-soluble vitamins that are expended during exercise include folate, riboflavin, niacin, thiamin and the B vitamins. If an athlete chooses to use supplements, then they may want to focus on supplements that will provide the necessary amounts of each of these micronutrients.
Vitamin E and Iron
Some athletes may want to pay attention to their Vitamin E and Iron intakes due to the higher chances for deficiency of these nutrients. Exercises that require a lot of energy usually cause the muscles to consume more oxygen, which in turn increases free radicals in the body. Antioxidants, specifically Vitamin E, help defend cells against any free radical damage that may occur. When free radicals are being produced more than antioxidants, oxidative stress will occur (Lobo et al., 2010). Oxidative stress can result in the damage of lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins which may interfere with DNA formation and the Electron Transport Chain. Vitamin E is necessary to reduce the chances of important cells being damaged in the body. Another micronutrient that needs attention is iron. Many young, active women are vulnerable to iron deficiency because the muscles absorb iron during strenuous exercise (Whitney & Rolfes, 2014). Women also lose a decent amount of iron through menstruation. Iron deficiencies can cause anemia which can result in an individual becoming more easily worn out during exercise. Individuals with an iron deficiency may be prescribed supplementation if needed, but many can obtain the necessary amounts of iron through a diet high in meats (especially red meat).

14.3.4 Anemia
[
]
Anemia is a condition that occurs when there is some malfunction in regards to a person’s hemoglobin – they either don’t produce enough of it, or any at all, their hemoglobin is ineffective in some aspect, or the body breaks it down too quickly. The result of all of these scenarios is that the body does not receive enough oxygen to its tissues. (1, 4) Although there are several causes of anemia, the leading cause is due to iron deficiency, which is also the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide. (2) According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, anemia is the most frequently occurring blood disorder, affecting greater than 3 million Americans. (3)
Symptoms
There are several symptoms indicative of anemia, these include:
•	Weakness/feeling fatigued
•	Dizziness
•	Headaches
•	Difficulty breathing
•	Pounding or “whooshing” sound in ears
•	Pale or yellow appearance
•	Feeling cold
•	Cognitive problems
•	Fast or irregular heartbeat
•	Chest pain
(3, 4)
Common types of anemia
There are several types of anemia that can occur as a result of different causes.
Iron-deficiency anemia – As mentioned, iron-deficiency anemia is the most commonly occurring form. As the name suggests, this form anemia occurs when there isn’t enough iron in the body. Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin for red blood cells. This form of anemia is almost always caused by blood loss or the inadequate absorption of iron.
Vitamin-deficiency anemia – Vitamin-deficiency anemia occurs when there are low levels of vitamin B12 or folic acid, both of which are essential components of healthy red blood cells. The result of this form of anemia is decreased red blood cell production as a result of poor absorption or inadequate intake of these vitamins.
Anemia due to chronic disease – Certain types of diseases (like HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, bone marrow diseases, etc.) can result in anemia in those affected by them because the disease may alter the body’s ability to make red blood cells. For example, some patients with kidney disease may find themselves in an anemic state as the kidneys are affected in such a way that they do not make enough of the erythropoietin hormone, which signals bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Thus, without sufficient amounts of this hormone, the body lacks red blood cells. Chemotherapy for cancers also causes the same effect.
Aplastic anemia – While relatively rare, aplastic anemia occurs when the body ceases to make enough red blood cells, or any red blood cells. Viral infections, autoimmune diseases, drugs, and exposure to toxic chemicals cause this type of anemia.
Hemolytic anemia – Hemolytic anemia arises when red blood cells are broken up in the bloodstream or spleen. This breakdown occurs faster than the rate at which bone marrow is able to reproduce the red blood cells. Certain blood diseases, congenital abnormalities, infections, or mechanical causes (such as leaky heart valves or aneurysms) are commonly the cause of hemolytic anemia.
Sickle cell anemia – This form of anemia occurs when red blood cells assume an abnormal, crescent shape. This unusual shape causes the cells to become rigid and stick together in the cells, causing clogs, commonly in small blood vessels – which can be fatal to those affected. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited, genetic disorder occurring in African Americans. (1, 3, 4)
Treatment
The treatment for anemia depends on the type of anemia diagnosed by the doctor. Iron- and vitamin-deficiency anemia may be treated (and prevented) by a change of diet to include foods higher in those components. Since iron-deficiency anemia may also be caused by blood loss somewhere in the body, the doctor may perform more extensive tests to investigate this and treat accordingly. For anemia caused by chronic disease and hemolytic anemia, management/treatment of the disease, or cause, will likely improve the effects of anemia. Aplastic anemia stems from bone marrow malfunctioning so this treatment may include medications or blood transfusions to try to manage the disorder. Sickle cell anemia doesn’t seem to have any current treatment; rather one with this disorder must adjust their lifestyle in such a way to diminish the risks associated. (1, 2, 3, 4)

Diet and Fitness
Intense Physical Activity on Female Athletes
Over the last several decades, it has become more common for women to participate
in collegiate, professional, and competitive sports. Being such an athlete requires
intense training, extensive physical strain on the body, as well as in some cases
restricted diets. Although this can be taxing on any athlete, many studies show there
are specific health risks for female athletes specifically competing at this level.
Who is at Risk?
Female athletes that train intensely and or do not get all of the nutrients they burn
throughout their day. Women involved in sports dependent on low body mass and
minimum body fat typically have more health problems (Fruth, Worrell, 1995).
Female cyclists, ballet dancers, cyclists, gymnasts, and swimmers are the sports that
require intense endurance training and low body weight. Also women that are
genetically predisposed to have certain health conditions can have a higher risk of
those conditions coming to fruition. An individual’s body that produces little
estrogen regardless of activity level is also associated with having more health risks
as a result of intense training (Fruth, Worrell, 1995).
Health Risks for Female Athletes
Of the negative affects of intense training, a common condition that can arise is
athletic amenorrhea, also known as hypothalamic hypogonadism. This is a condition
where the individual’s monthly menstruation has ceased for anywhere from 3 to 12
months straight. Though this may seem like a positive affect of physical activity, it
can have long-term detriments. Women with this condition have a decrease in bone
density and may even never be able to achieve their peak bone density. This is a
slow and subtle process leading to premature osteoporosis (Clark, 1997). This
makes it difficult to catch and treat before injuries occur. Athletes with amenorrhea
are also at a three times greater risk for stress fractures as a result of the decrease in
their bone density (Clark, 1997). Also women who have amenorrhea and participate
in extreme amounts of training are extremely likely to have low amounts of
estradiol in their bodies. Estradiol is the main form of the hormone estrogen in
females’ bloodstreams. These levels are almost always too low because adipose fat
tissue is a place where this hormone is converted from androgens. Since these
individuals have such low amounts of body fat these hormones are extremely lower
than normal (Fruth, Worrell, 1995).
As well as decreasing bone density and causing amenorrhea, intense physical
activity has been associated with infertility. There was a study done in 1979 that
compared the ovulations of runner athletes with those of a control group. Only 50%
of the runner athletes ovulated at all, compared to the 83% of the control group that
did (Dale, 1979). This can be a major health concern for women of childbearing age
who wish to be pregnant.
Treatment
Most sources agree that either eating a bit more or exercising a bit less will reverse
some of the affects of intense physical activity and inadequate diets. Diets are very
important for individuals who expend so many nutrients, such as endurance
athletes. It is beneficial to eat 0.5- 0.75 grams of additional protein each day or
decrease activity level by 5-15% (Clark, 2001). Also gaining 1–2 kg of body weight
can reverse amenorrhea and improve bone health. However, these
recommendations are often hard to follow, as many athletes don’t want to
jeopardize their athletic performance or appearance.

14.3.5 Fluid and Electrolytes to Support Activity
Added by Emma Hovey
Fluid Overview
Due to a high metabolic rate, the sweat level of athletes is high (Fischer-Colbrie, 2015). If exercise is frequent and intense, athletes need to be consuming appropriate liquids to compromise for the lost fluids. The lack of fluid intake can lead to dehydration. Dehydration can not only impair an athlete’s performance, but also have serious health implications. Hydration is an important way to maintain endurance levels and keep the body at equilibrium. Dehydration impacts a workout by leading to lower performance levels, increases perceived exertion, and can cause an individual fatigue. Not only does the overall performance of an athlete decline when dehydration, but post-exercise recovery suffers as well. When deprived of fluids, the body has to work harder to repair muscle tissues and remove bloodstream waste.
Fluid and Electrolyte Balance
Physical exercise increases the contraction of skeletal muscles. This action raises the body’s total metabolism to function at least five times the rate of an individual’s resting heart rate. The majority of this energy is given off by heat. In particularly warm environments, body fluids may be lost through sweat, cooling off the body, therefore aiding in equilibrium (Mountain&Sawka, 2000). Electrolytes, along with water, are lost in sweat. Sodium chloride is the major electrolyte lost in sweat. The minor electrolytes lost are calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The balance of these minerals lost via sweat varies on the individual. During exercise, it is important rehydrate the body with fluids lost by sweating. Thirst is a poor indicator of dehydration. Once an individual experiences the sensation, they have lost up to two percent of their body fluid.
'
Replacement of Lost Fluids and Electrolytes'
Replacing electrolytes and fluids lost during exercise is critical for an athlete’s performance and recovery. Specific electrolytes are time sensitive, being better absorbed before, during, or after exercise (Dolan, n.d.). Electrolytes are used to maintain fluid balance in the human body. They play a role in conducting electrical activity and are charged ions. Having a proper balance of electrolytes allows the body to not only regulate the balance of fluids, but muscle and neural activity as well. The main organs assisting in fluid regularity are the kidneys. They balance electrolyte levels by conserving or excreting electrolytes. Due to the polarity of water molecules, they follow the locations in the body that are highly concentrated with electrolytes.  Specific foods help to replace specific electrolytes. A deficiency in sodium, for example, may manifest as a muscle cramp. Food sources to replace this lost electrolyte range from a dill pickle to a glass of tomato juice.

Hydration
Ergogenic Aids
14.4 Hydration
Water is one of the six essential nutrients that humans need to survive. Water is so important because it supports every cell in the human body, allowing the body to maintain proper hydration throughout the day (Hydration, 2015). Understanding the importance of hydration, consuming adequate amounts of liquid, and being aware of when at risk for dehydration are all important factors for humans to sustain proper hydration.
Staying hydrated is critical. Water in the human body is used in every cell to support mental, physical, and everyday performance (Water balance, 2006). If the body is not hydrated it will slowly not be able to function. This will lead to dehydration, the opposite of hydration. Our bodies become dehydrated from everyday activities. Water is used every time the human body excretes waste, sweats, exhales, inhales, or has an increase in temperature (Hydration, 2015). Humans lose water rapidly throughout the day. Luckily hydration can be easily maintained if monitored regularly.
The average daily recommendation for water consumption is six to eight eight-ounce cups of water every day (Hydration, 2015). A sign that an individual is not hydrated is when their urine appears yellow or if they are thirsty. Not every individual is the same when it comes to how much water they need to maintain hydration throughout the day. Those that are pregnant, have diabetes, have a heart disease, or other medical conditions are all at risk of becoming dehydrated quicker (Staying Hydrated, 2014). There are other various factors including temperature, clothing, and activity that can affect an individual’s state of hydration (Staying Hydrated, 2014). It is important to keep these factors in mind when trying to achieve daily hydration along with what enhances hydration. Water is not the only way to stay hydrated. Most drinks such as juice, soda, coffee, water, etc. can add to the body’s daily hydration (Water balance, 2006). Fruits and vegetables are also foods high in water that help the body stay hydrated (Staying Hydrated, 2014).
When exercising or sweating individuals need to be aware of water loss and remember to keep sodium loss in mind. It is important to remember that following these events an individual should intake water along with a snack or a drink containing sodium such as Gatorade (Water balance, 2006). Sodium is important because it allows the body to absorb the water quicker which will help the individual to regain hydration (Water balance, 2006).

14.4.1 Types of fluid replacement
Where beverages are a significant source for water, foods can also have a high water
content and can help to reach the daily recommended water intake. Specifically, many fruits and
vegetables serve as good sources because they can contain upwards of 90 percent water content
(“Hydrating”, 2014). Among these includes celery, watermelon, cauliflower, and tomatoes, as
well as different kinds of peppers and berries. In particular, the food with the highest water
content is cucumbers, which consist of 97 percent water.
In extreme cases, such as dehydration or illnesses, beverages and foods may not be
enough to supply the body with the water it needs. If this occurs, artificial hydration may be
required (“Artificial Hydration”, 2000). This can be achieved through either one of two
procedures, Intravenous (IV) fluid replacement, or subcutaneous fluid replacement called
hypodermoclysis. IV fluid replacement involves putting the fluid directly into the vein, whereas
hypodermoclysis involves putting the fluid underneath the skin. Artificial hydration can serve
many benefits to someone who urgently needs to be rehydrated. However, it can also help to
prevent a person from becoming dehydrated if they are unable to swallow foods or beverages
(“Artificial Hydration”, 2000). Since it is important to closely monitor the patient receiving IV
fluids, they are often administered in hospitals. This is so doctors and nurses can both watch and
determine further courses of action to take to help the patient.
With varying intensities and duration of exercises comes varying needs of fluid
replacement (Maughan and Shirreffs, 2010). In particular, athletes can lose significant amounts
of water through practice and intense exercise, so it is important for them to stay hydrated
throughout their performance. Athletes should begin exercise well hydrated, and despite the type
of exercise (aerobic or anaerobic), it is still important to maintain proper fluid intake at all times.
Even in cases where endurance exercises are being performed, dehydration and fluid loss will
occur as long as sweat loss is higher than fluid intake (Maughan and Shirreffs, 2010). In some
cases, if an athlete fails to adequately replace their electrolyte intake, but consistently replaces
their water intake, hyponatremia may occur. This is where in longer periods of exercise- over 3
hours- the body begins to lose electrolytes, and with the increasing amounts of plain water,
ultimately diluting the body’s fluids and resulting in dangerously low sodium concentrations.
While all of these chiefly pertain to athletes, dehydration, rehydration, and hyponatremia should
be a concern to anyone who exercises, especially over long periods of time without adequate
fluid replacement.

14.4.2 Recommendations
Hydration Recommendations
Staying properly hydrated is one of the most important factors for maintaining one’s
health. Bodies need to have the correct amount of fluid in order to provide energy for daily tasks,
drive organ systems, eliminate toxins, and complete a myriad of other tasks (Mayo Clinic Staff,
2014). While hydration is important to everyone’s health, the amount of fluids required to ensure
proper hydration can vary greatly from person to person. Multiple studies on what constitutes
adequate hydration have drawn multiple conclusions that all slightly differ. Several factors can
affect one’s hydration needs, such as one’s level of activity, health, and even one’s environment
(Mayo Clinic Staff, 2014). Despite these influences, there are some general guidelines that, if
followed, will help a person maintain proper hydration. According to the Institute of Medicine
and the Mayo Clinic Staff, in order to balance fluid loss on a daily basis, healthy males need to
intake around 13 cups of fluid, and healthy females need around 9 cups (2014). These
recommendations are similar to the popular 8X8 rule which states that an individual needs to
consume around eight, eight ounce glasses of fluid a day (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2014).
Environmental factors that could increase how many fluids an individual needs in a day
are things like altitude and humidity levels. Health conditions that cause symptoms like diarrhea,
vomiting, or high fever will require an individual to drink more fluids in order to replace those
that have been lost. Two special populations that have different hydration recommendations are
females who are pregnant or breast-feeding. These two populations, especially the nursing
population, require a greater amount of additional fluids than what is advised for the general
female population. Women who are breast-feeding are recommended to drink around thirteen
cups of fluid on a daily basis and women who are pregnant are advised to drink around ten cups
of fluid on a daily basis (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2014). Due to the fact that each individual has
different hydration needs, the Mayo Clinic Staff recommends consulting a doctor to learn what
fluid intake is correct for each individual to avoid dehydration or over hydration (2014).
Another group of people who has a different set of hydration guidelines is athletes or
those involved in regular moderate to intense activity. This group of people needs to take several
steps in order to maintain healthy levels of hydration before, during, and after exercising. The
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends establishing a baseline hydration
level that will let an athlete/exerciser know the level they should try to stay around (Simpson and
Howard, 2011). The ACSM also recommends that starting around four hours before an
athlete/exerciser begins exercising, he or she drinks about sixteen to twenty ounces of fluid,
preferably water or a sports beverage, and an additional eight to twelve ounces ten to fifteen
minutes before becoming active (Simpson and Howard, 2011). If a person is going to be
exercising for less than an hour, the ACSM recommends drinking three to eight ounces of water
every fifteen to twenty minutes, and three to eight ounces of a sports drink every fifteen to
twenty minutes if the exercise will last longer than an hour (Simpson and Howard, 2011).
Another recommendation is to not drink more than a quart of liquid in less than an hour while
exercising (Simpson and Howard, 2011). The last step is to replace the fluids that were lost. This
can be done by drinking twenty to twenty-four ounces of fluid for every pound that was lost
during the exercise (Simpson and Howard, 2011).
The types of fluids that one chooses to hydrate with is also very important. In general,
water is enough to maintain healthy levels, however if a person is exercising for longer than an
hour or at a higher intensity, a sports drink may be more helpful. This is because sports drinks
contain electrolytes, calories, potassium, and various other nutrients that can help prolong the
amount of time that an individual can perform an exercise. Even though these drinks can be
helpful in maintaining proper hydration it is important to be aware that they can contain some
less beneficial ingredients, such as caffeine and added sugars (Athletes, 2015).

14.4.3 Dehydration
Dehydration in the body arises when there is a loss of fluids in the body. The body can no longer carry out basic functions when it does not have enough water or fluids. During dehydration, the ratio of water leaving the body is higher than the ratio of water entering. Simple everyday functions like breathing and sweating also contribute to water loss in the body. Dehydration can be divided into three stages: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild and moderate cases can be balanced if an individual slowly drinks water or fluids that contain electrolytes. If left untreated severe cases can lead to death. Infants and the elderly are at higher risk for dehydration. People with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes, are at more risk of becoming dehydrated (Derrer, 2013). Furthermore, individuals with kidney and heart problems are also likely to become dehydrated. Suffering from dehydration can lead to serious complications such as seizures, swelling of the brain, and kidney failure. In severe conditions fluids may be given to a patient through an IV tube in order for the body to retain fluids more quickly (David, 2014).
	For specialists to confirm that a patient is suffering from dehydration doctors perform a series of tests. A blood sample test checks the concentration of electrolytes, such as, sodium and potassium in the body (David, 2014). Furthermore, a urinalysis test examines urine and evaluates the severity of the patients’ dehydration (David, 2014). Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day and eating foods that are high in water content can avoid dehydration. For instance, fruits and vegetables like cucumbers and tomatoes can help maintain proper hydration. In hot and humid weather conditions individuals should drink additional fluids to replace the amount of water lost due to sweating.
	If someone is suffering from dehydration they should try to relocate to a cool and air-conditioned space. Alcohol consumption can increase an individual’s chances of being dehydrated, especially in warm weather (Dehydration, 2014). It is best to stay hydrated before and after starting physical work or vigorous exercise. Clear and diluted urine is a good sign that an individual is healthy and hydrated. Athletes should also monitor their fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Medical attention should be considered if someone experiences symptoms of diarrhea for more than 2 days or has a fever over 101 °F (Derrer, 2013).
Common triggers of dehydration include:
Strong exercise
Hot weather
Fever
Vomiting or diarrhea
Symptoms between mild and moderate dehydration include:
Headache
Thirst
Dry and/or sticky mouth
Dark yellow urine
Fatigue
Symptoms of severe conditions include:
Dry, shrunken skin
Rapid heartbeat
Dizziness
Not urinating
High fever

14.4.4 Heat Stroke
Heatstroke is a condition where the body has become overheated and can become dangerous or even fatal as the body reaches and passes 104 °F. It is the condition caused by extreme hyperthermia, in which the body is unable to cool itself by evaporating sweat. Heatstroke is often caused by strenuous physical activity in hot weather, but can occur in the absence of heat or exercise (Lissoway). Exertional heatstroke is caused by physical activity in hot weather and is considered to be the first or second leading cause of death among young athletes up to high school (CDC). Classic heatstroke usually affects elderly people who are exposed to heat through multiple consecutive days and remain dehydrated.
Dehydration is often the cause, as is alcohol consumption. Outdoor music festivals, where alcohol consumption is high, are places of high heat stroke risk because people are standing in the sun all day while actually dehydrating themselves by consuming alcohol. Victims of heatstroke may become confused, nauseous, light-headed, or have a headache. Without treatment, heatstroke can cause damage to the brain and other organs, or even cause death. Treatment of heatstroke includes rehydration and cooling off. This can be done quickly with shade and air conditioning, but also with a cool water bath or damp cloths in the armpits, forehead, and neck. Although the immediate treatment is simple, an ambulance should be called or the victim should see a doctor due to the serious or even fatal effects that heat stroke can have. As always, the best treatment is prevention. Sunburn, alcohol, and certain medications all impair the body’s ability to regulate temperature. Always wear sunscreen when outside for long periods of time and avoid alcohol consumption before physical activity or even just being outside in the heat for long time. Alcohol consumption is often the cause of heatstroke at outdoor sporting events such as NFL or college football games. The stadium setting of these games adds to the often-hot weather. Another common cause of heatstroke is being in a car that is parked in the sun on a hot day. This has accounted for many deaths among children but is not safe for anyone as the car actually becomes hotter than the outside temperature, and does so quickly.
People who are at risk of hyperthermia and heatstroke are athletes, people who work outdoors in heat, overweight people, and people who have trouble staying hydrated (Calvin, 2012). These people should always try to stay hydrated, wear loose-fitting clothing that allows for sweat evaporation, know how to contact the local emergency services in case of any heat related emergency, and plan their physical activity based on the weather. Athletes may prefer to do their workouts in the morning or evening when it is much cooler and they are at less risk of hyperthermia. Youth and elderly are also at an increased risk of heat stroke. It is important for youth participating in youth sports leagues to remain hydrated, but this responsibility often falls on the parents as the youth don’t realize the importance of staying hydrated or recognize when they are becoming dehydrated.

Ergogenic Aids
[
]
Many substances, objects, or treatments are ergogenic, meaning work enhancing. Ergogenic aids are substances, devices, practices, or treatments that improves athletic or physical performance. Ergogenic aids can improve physical functions, as well as mental functions by removing psychological constraints that may impact physical performance. Some ergogenic aids have harmful side-effects and some have even been banned in professional sports. Ergogenic aids can come in many forms, ranging from very simplistic techniques or processes to drug supplementation. Forms of ergogenic aids include physiological, psychological, mechanical, pharmacological, and nutritional aids.
Dietary Supplements that Perform as Claimed
Convenient dietary supplements
These supplements include energy bars, gels, and drinks, and liquid meal replacers.  Convenient dietary supplements provide extra energy and can be useful before competition.  However they do not provide complete nutrition and should be used as supplements and not as a replacement for food.
Caffeine
Caffeine can enhance endurance and support high intensity exercise for short durations.  It also improves alertness and can reduce fatigue.  Caffeine also appears to spare glycogen by releasing fatty acids in the blood and triglycerides in muscles. (Graham & Lawrence, 1996)  However, caffeine can cause side effects such as headache, nervousness, and stomach discomfort.  The NCAA restricts caffeine use for athletes.
Creatine
Creatine improves high intensity, repetitive exercise but does not help with endurance exercise.  Creatine can also increase muscle mass and strength, along with its glycogen capacity.  Creatine cause weight gain.  It is quite widely used among athletes.  There do not appear to be negative side effects however long term effects are unclear and those with kidney disease may be at risk.  Some have claimed that can cause heat illness however tests do not suppor such claims. (Rawson & Clarkson, 2003)
Sodium Bicarbonate
Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes acid and carbon dioxide produced during high intensity activity when taken before activity.  This causes exercise capacity to increase, however it may also cause diarrhea.
Beta-alanine
Beta-alanine raises the concentration of carnosine, a buffer, in muscles.  This is helpful for high intensity activity.  A potential side effect is a “pins and needles” sensation.
Dietary Supplements that May Perform as Claimed
Beta-hydroxymethylbutyrate
Beta- hydroxymethylbutyrate increases muscle strength and size in untrained athletes.  It is unclear if supplements are beneficial in trained individuals.
Ribose
Ribose is claimed to raise ATP levels and improve performance.  Ribose plays a role in ATP synthesis in muscle however research does not support these claims.
Dietary Supplements that Do Not Perform as Claimed
Carnitine
Carnitine helps to transfer fatty acids across membranes of the mitochondria.  It is claimed to raise fatty acid oxidation however supplements do not increase concentrations in muscle cells.
Chromium picolinate
Chromium plays a role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.  Some say chromium picolinate is more absorbable than regular chromium.  They also claim it increases strength and decreases fat.  These claims however are unsupported.
Banned Supplements
Pharmacological Aids
[
]
Pharmacological ergogenic aids can be described as drugs, both legal and illegal, that are used to enhance physical performance. Pharmacological aids are commonly used by athletes of various sports competitions in order to gain a more competitive edge. They should be used with caution as pharmacological aids can have harmful side-effects and can potentially be dangerous or life-threatening when abused. Before taking a pharmacological aid, it is important to conduct research to find out the effectiveness of the drug, any possible side effects, and if the drug is legal.
Common examples of pharmacological ergogenic aids include:
Amphetamines – Improves concentration, decreases fatigue and appetite
Anabolic steroids – Increases training time and intensity of workouts, as well as reduces recovery time.
Beta-hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) – Improves strength and muscle mass
Creatine – Increases muscle energy, short term endurance, strength, and lean muscle mass
Caffeine – Stimulates the central nervous system, increases focus and alertness.
Carnitine – Claimed to increase fat metabolism
Chromium picolinate – Falsely promoted to build muscle, enhance energy, and burn fat
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) – Increases endogenous steroid production
Human growth hormone (hGH) – Hormone naturally produced in the pituitary gland that regulates growth and development.
Harmful and Illegal Pharmacological Ergogenic Aids
Laws and regulation prohibit a number of ergogenic aids in non-medically prescribed circumstances; a fair amount of ergogenic aids have also been banned by major sporting commissions such as the Olympic commission due to their ability to increase athletic performance or due to the negative effects that they may have on a player (Krans, 2014). Some of these “banned” substances included HGH, anabolic steroids, and Ephedrine. A more descriptive and full list will be found below:
Anabolic and other steroids:
Steroids are a class of drugs that are usually injected or taken orally. They are sometimes prescribed for medical conditions, but, when abused, are usually taken in amounts that exceed normally dosing by 10 to 100 times. Anabolic-Androgenic steroids, as they are formally known, are often used by athletes to increase strength and muscle mass, however, there are numerous side effects that can result in irreversible changes to the body and even prove fatal, such as heart enlargement (Piccoli, 1991.)
Another widely used steroid is known as DHEA, or androstenolone, is a widely present steroid hormone in humans. It is often used as an ergogenic aid to increase strength and improve body composition. Like anabolic steroids, side effects include an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is why they are banned among sport commissions (Medscape, 2010.)
Ephedrine:
Ephedrine is a Central Nervous System stimulating drug that can be used to simulate adrenaline in human body. This often results in a decrease in fatigue, which is why numerous athletes have used it as a performance-enhancing drug. Ephedrine can also be found in a number of prescription class drugs such as antihistamines (Gilles et al., 1996.) Harmful side effects of Ephedrine include stroke, psychosis, and death.
Human Growth Hormone (HGH):
HGH is a man-made growth hormone that was originally synthesized to aid children with growth deficiencies. It is still used today to treat disorders such as HGH Deficiency, premature birth, and Turner's syndrome. However, due to its effects that include regulation of body composition, muscle and bone growth, and sugar and fat metabolism it has become a popular drug among those looking for an athletic “edge.” Not only has it been banned due to its performance-enhancing capabilities, but it also comes along with numerous side effects, such as nerve pain, raised cholesterol, and edema, that can prove dangerous (WebMD, 2014.)
Blood Doping:
Probably one of the better-known ergogenic aids in the media recently is known as blood doping, which is the injection of red blood cells into the blood stream. The effect this has is that there is a higher concentration of blood carrying cells in the body, which can increase a person's aerobic capacity (Also known as VO2 Max.) Blood doping is more of a category than an actual aid as it encompasses blood doping aids such as EPO, Hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizers, and Darbepoetin Alfa (Lunby, 2011.) Some of the adverse effects of blood doping include decreased cardiac output, blood contamination, and decreased liver function.
Anabolic steroids
The anabolic steroids are the most dangerous of these supplements.  They are related to testosterone and increase lean body mass and strength.  Negative side effects include aggression, hostility, baldness, heart disease and liver damage.  Use by adolescents can hinder growth. (Yesalis & Bahrke, 2015)
DHEA and Androstenedione
DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) and androstenedione are adrenal gland hormones and precursors for testosterone.  They are claimed to build muscle but these claims are unsupported.  These substances can cause acne, aggression, testicular shrinkage, and liver damage.
hGH
Human growth hormone is hormone produced by the pituitary gland.  Supplements promote lean tissue growth.  Supplementation can cause several side effects including diabetes, heart disease, thyroid disorder, and acromegaly.  In acromegaly bones and organs grow too much.
Nutritional Aids
[
]
Ergogenic aids are defined as “substances or treatments that purportedly improve athletic performance above and beyond what is possible through training”(Whitney).. Nutritional aids are one of the more common types of the various ergogenic aids. This section of ergogenic aids are used by many athletes, usually professional, primarily to “[enhance] performance at increasing lean body mass or muscle mass by stimulation of protein synthesis and at reducing body fat content” (Maughan 2009). In addition to these helpful aspects, supplements that help to ward off infection and disease can help to aid in performance indirectly. Although not defined as ergogenic aids, these can help by reducing the risk of illness and therefore reduce interruptions from training (Maughan 2009).
Many of the nutritional aids can help enhance performance and work as they claim to. Others may work as they claim to and many others fall under the category of not performing how they claim. (Whitney)
Perform as Claimed
Caffeine: Caffeine is readily available and can be an effective ergogenic supplement. Considered a stimulant, caffeine is thought to increase alertness and improve reaction time. (Brolinson). It can help with fast intense training, as well as longer, more endurance based training. Caffeine stimulates the release of fatty acids during endurance activities but does not reduce muscle glycogen use. In fact some use caffeine because it can increase the circulation FFA in the blood in order to "spare" glycogen because it alters the utilization of substrates. (Thein). In addition to sparing glycogen use, because caffeine is a stimulant, it can enhance alertness and reduce fatigue and in turn can increase performance. Too much caffeine can cause adverse affects and intake should be monitored. (Whitney)
Creatine: Studies show that creatine is one of the most popular ergogenic aids used throughout sports right now. Supplementing with creatine can replenish phosphocreatine stored in the muscles when it combines with the phosphate in the muscles this in increases “turnover of adenosine triphosphate during exercise involving short, intermittent bursts of anaerobic activity (Brolinson).”  It primarily is used for high intensity activities because in the long, run high intensity training can actually make muscles adapt and in turn, perform better. In fact, there is evidence that shows that emphasis on short-term high-intensity exercise can be improved by supplementation” (Maughan 2009). Although creatine has been found effective in short term intensity workouts, it does not help to improve endurance. Specifically, creatine is a more effective ergogenic supplement in increasing muscle strength and size, and cell hydration. (Maughan 2009)
Sodium Bicarbonate: Sodium bicarbonate is an ergogenic supplement that can be very effective. When ingested it can actually enhance exercise capacity by neutralizing some of the carbon dioxide that builds up in the body during exercise. The recommended dosage is .3 g per kilogram body weight.  (Whitney) Although it can be very helpful it is warned that there is a “significant risk of adverse gastrointestinal side effects” (Maughan 2009).

Nutritional ergogenic aids generally consists of organic substances used to enhance physical performance and are typically a healthy alternative to pharmacological aids. Nutritional ergogenic aids can vary from alterations of the fluid, carbohydrate, fat, and protein content in a diet, to nutrient and food supplements in various form of tablets, liquids, bars, injections or powders. Common examples of nutritional aids include protein, carbohydrates or fat in the form of powders or bars, sports drinks such as Gatorade, as well as vitamins and minerals.
Nutritional aids can be classified as:
Products that enhance physical performance, specifically strength, speed, power, or endurance.
Products that change body composition.
Products that enhance recovery.

Anorexia Nervosa
Bulemia Nervosa
An Overview of Anorexia Nervosa
[
]
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by weight loss (or lack of appropriate weight gain in growing children). The individuals that suffer from this disorder find it difficult to maintain an appropriate body weight relative to their size, age, height, and stature (1).  Those who are anorexic, likely have a distorted body image that leads them to eliminate food from their diet Often their routine will consist of weighing themselves frequently, eating only small amounts, and only eating certain foods. Also some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to increase weight loss (4). It is also common for those with anorexia to have other mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, OCD, or substance abuse. Much of the time, people with anorexia will perceive themselves as heavier than they really are. We often see shows or movies about this disease where adolescent girls look into the mirror and see themselves as “fat” and in reality, they are severely underweight. Sometimes, however, a person with anorexia can accept the fact that they are very thin but cannot or will not accept the danger that they are putting themselves in. Generally, anorexia develops during adolescence, most often affecting women between the ages of 12-25 (2). However, anorexia is now known to affect both males and females, spanning all ages, socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial groups. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of anorexia has become more common over the past 20 years. This can be attributed to the increase in media in recent years. The media places a huge stressor on young girls to fit some kind of ideal image of a woman. An image in which women should have curves, but not be heavy, have thin legs but also have nice breasts and a butt. Even though anorexia has no single cause, experts believe that anorexia is a mental disorder influenced by biological, psychological, and environmental factors (3). To be diagnosed with Anorexia, there are criteria set by the DSM-5. The individual must restrict energy intake relative to requirements that causes them to have a significantly low body weight. They much have a significant fear of gaining weight or becoming fat even though they are severely underweight. This individual must also have a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced in accordance with a denial of the severity of their low body weight.The typical outline of a person with anorexia nervosa is usually an adolescent to young adult female who considers themselves a “perfectionistic”. However, is not unusual for these individuals to be attributed with having a low self-esteem based on body image distortion. Regardless of the general make up of this individual, weight control habits focused on reducing intake of calories is what helps to reduce their anxiety, stress, and negative mood by giving this person a sense of control in at least one aspect of her/his life. In a way, those that suffer from this disorder get a sense of accomplishment when weight is lost (2). Like all other eating disorders, anorexia nervosa is not an easy obstacle to overcome. Treatment can be challenging and relapse isn’t uncommon. Some medicinal treatments could include antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics if necessary. Though these are certainly helpful, effective treatment most often includes a form of therapy. These treatments will often try to dig deeper to locate the underlying emotional and mental health issues that may date back into the individuals early childhood and examines person’s self-perception and self-image (5). According to experts, the most challenging part of treating this disorder is getting the patient to understand that they have a serious mental illness (5). There lies a stigma around different disorders and diseases that may affect the individual’s ability to comprehend what is really going on. While there are several different routes to choose from when it comes to treatment for anorexia nervosa, there are a few essential steps to take. Most treatment begins with a one on one meeting with an eating disorder specialist. This psychologist has deep experience and training in helping those affected by this disorder and is an essential participant in this therapy. Another important step in this process is a physical examination by a medical doctor. This is a necessary step because it is important that the patient is informed of any physical problems can be dealt with if they are in danger of something worse happening. Of any psychological disorder Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate (4). Though there are many treatment options available, not every individual is able to fully recover from this disorder. About 20% of people develop anorexia nervosa as a chronic disorder (4). According to the National Eating Disorders Association, at any given time, .3 to .4 percent of young women and .1 percent of men will suffer from Anorexia. In a study of 496 adolescent girls over a time span of 8 years, 5.2 percent of girls met criteria for some form of eating disorder. Because of the serious malnutrition associated with those who have anorexia, this disorder can lead to many other health defects down the road. These include impaired brain and nerve function, thinning of hair, cardiovascular complications, bone and muscle impairments, hormone disruption, skin problems kidney failure and even death if gone untreated for too long. Though someone with anorexia may be in denial about his or her condition, it is important to get that person to help in order to be able to attain a normal body weight and set them on the right path to recovery.
Anorexia Nervosa: What is it?
[
]
Anorexia Nervosa, commonly referred to as anorexia, is an eating disorder in which an individual restricts his or her intake of calories. Those affected by this disorder lack many of the vital nutrients needed to complete everyday tasks. They are often characterized by their pronounced physical problems, such as thinning hair, visible bone protrusions and unhealthy dry and thin skin. People with anorexia often live with a poor body image, thinking they are too fat- when they are often of normal if not below average weight, and respond to such with excessive exercising, reduced food intake, calorie counting, vomiting after eating, increased water consumption or misusing diet aids (mayoclinic.org, 2014). They usually correlate their thinness with their self-worth, meaning that they presume that the thinner they get the more self-worth they will have, but in actuality this does not happen. Simply stated, anorexia can be identified as a mental problem, “an attempt to deal with perfectionism and a desire to gain control by strictly regulating food and weight.” (Anorexia nervosa)
As anorexia worsens, it can become all encompassing, affecting both physical and mental states. The disorder is often characterized by a lower than normal Body Mass Index (under 18.5 kg/m2). Due to this low BMI and lack of proper food intake, many are often found to have reached a point of severe malnutrition resulting in significant depletion of vitamins and minerals as well as fat and protein, thus impeding on normal body development. As the body begins to slow itself down to conserve the little energy it makes, it can lead to severe health consequences that can be life-threatening, such as osteoporosis, heart failure, kidney failure, and mental complications like depression and anxiety (Health Consequences of Eating Disorders). Some body systems are specifically affected such as digestive, integumentary, nervous and cardiovascular. As weight loss increases, it is common for those with anorexia nervosa to be prone to bruising and lanugo hair growth. Bloating, acute gastric pain and constipation are also present(Mehler,2001). Despite this weakening of the systems however, patients are not more predisposed to infectious disease than prior. Depending on the age, amenorrhea can also result or the menstruation cycle onset will even be delayed in females who have yet to begin their cycle. The extent of malnutrition that anorexia leads to can affect judgment as well, making it difficult to reason with the individual of their own current state.
Anorexia can overwhelm an individual’s life, as they dedicate their time to the time consuming exercises, frequent weigh-ins and more. As mentioned prior, vomiting is another form of losing weight, tying in to another eating disorder known as bulimia. It has been found that about half of individuals with anorexia suffer from bulimia(Mehler,2001). They may be seen cutting their food into smaller portions, eating slower as well as restricting themselves to certain foods. Due to the obsession component of this disorder, even after weight loss has occurred, individuals typically continue to control food and exercise regimens because of his or her inability to see any physical difference. In certain cases, anorexic patients use food and exercise to control an aspect of their lives. An anorexic individual may have large life changes surrounding him or her that cannot be controlled, so this control that anorexia entails may ease the anxiety that is being produced from everyday life.
Anorexia is one of the most common eating disorders and psychological diseases. It occurs most commonly in teenagers and those in their twenties, but can affect people in all age ranges.  It can occur in both males and females; with females making the majority. Internationally, approximately 90-95% of those diagnosed with this disorder are girls and women. In the United States, about 0.5 – 1% of women suffer from anorexia nervosa, which accounts for at least 793,000 women (Anorexia nervosa). As every case is different, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact cause as many factors come into play, be it severe trauma, emotional stress before or during puberty, abnormalities in brain chemistry, i.e., serotonin,  cultural/social environment, family history and so on (Ehrlich). What is known however is that the disorder is highly heritable and several other factors may play into its onset such as prenatal complications, gastrointestinal diseases and dysregulation of the neuroendocrine systems (Rikani, 2013). Comorbidities can also be found as well, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bipolar disordering being some of the more prominent ones (Herpertz-Dahlmann, 2009). Less commonly, type I Diabetes Mellitus, anemia and leukopenia can also occur (Mehler, 2001).
Unfortunately, someone who has dealt with anorexia nervosa may continue to struggle with it for the rest of his or her life (Anorexia Nervosa Facts Sheet). Between 5-20% of these individuals struggling with anorexia will die due to the lack of food and essential nutrition, making this condition one with the highest death rates of any mental health condition (Anorexia nervosa). As they typically suffer from depression and other comorbidities as well, suicide is another frequent cause of death if not from the malnutrition.

Signs
[
]
- Taking diet pills (also diuretics and laxatives)
- Excessive exercise, even when sick or hurt
- Being excessively thin
- Not eating or eating very little
- Weigh their foods/count calories
- Weighing themselves multiple times a day
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Obsessive disorders
- Physical development is stunted
- Kidney and heart problems
- Some people even become suicidal
If anorexia is not treated the person could develop severe, life altering problems that could eventually kill them. People that have this illness usually are treated before their symptoms become life-threatening. It can cause women that are pregnant to lose their child or bare a child that is severely malnourished and underweight. It affects the hormones of both men and women causing mild to severe mood swings.
Symptoms
[
]
Anorexia Nervosa affects many bodily functions. If a young adolescent becomes anorexic, growth and development my slow or stop all together. If a young adolescent female becomes anorexic, her menstrual cycle may never start, or if the menstrual cycle does begin the cycle could cease to continue; this phenomenon is called amenorrhea. Anorexic patients may lose lean body mass and slow their basal metabolic rate. The cardiac systems may also be affected often leading to bradycardia (slow heart rate). In an attempt to stay warm, the body may start producing lanugo (soft hair that may help insulate the body). The body systems will react similarly to someone who is malnourished or starved, and multiple organs may stop functioning all together if the starvation continues (Whitney, 2015).
Risk Factors
[
]
There are many risk factors that can increase the risk this disease. According to the Mayo Clinic (2014), the following are some of the typical risk factors for anorexia nervosa:
Biological sex
: Women and girls are more likely to have anorexia. However, anorexia in men and boys has started to increase, presumably as a result of increasing pressures by society for men to have a certain physical appearance along with women.
Age
: Anorexia is seen to be the most prevalent among teenagers. Teenagers are seen to be more susceptible to contracting anorexia due to the bodily changes that they undergo during puberty. During this time, teenagers are subjected to outside pressure from peers and can thereby be more sensitive to criticism about their body or weight. Although a person of any age can develop anorexia, anorexia is rare in people over 40.
Changes in Weight
: Weight loss may be reinforced by positive comments, whereas weight loss may be reinforced by negative criticism. These comments may cause someone to either start an extreme diet or even starve themselves.
Transitions/Life Changes
: A change in environment or social relationships can increase the risk of developing anorexia due to the emotional hardships transitions can cause.
Career or Hobby Choice
: Those who work in or participate regularly in sports, acting, modeling, and dance are seen to have a higher risk of developing anorexia due to how these professions may increasingly continually suggest that a person involved in these must maintain a certain weight and appearance.
Media
: TV, movies, and fashion magazines regularly perpetuate that being “skinny” is the norm by regularly featuring skinny actors and models. This may suggest to viewers that being thin is directly related to how popular and successful one is.
Anorexia is also seen as a genetic predisposition that may run in families. A girl whose brother or sister struggles  with anorexia may be ten to twenty times more likely to develop anorexia herself when compared to girls who do not have a sibling with anorexia. In addition, the chemical makeup of the brain is also seen to be a risk factor for anorexia. Those with anorexia are typically seen to have increased levels of cortisol (hormone that brings about feelings of stress) and lower levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, which bring about feelings of well-being (Smith & Segal, 2015).
Diagnosing Anorexia Nervosa
[
]
The main indication of anorexia is the refusal to keep a body weight at or greater than 85 percent of one’s expected body weight. This is defined by comparing one’s current body mass index to their predicted “normal” BMI. Another main sign of anorexia is a patient’s excessive uses of calorie restriction and exercising. A additional hallmark of diagnosing anorexia is an extreme fear of gaining weight or becoming overweight (Pritts & Susman, 2003).
Treatment
[
]
Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa
Treating anorexia nervosa is a multi step process that includes different types of support.  If someone is seriously affected by anorexia nervosa the first step is to “stop weight loss” at all costs (Whitney Rolfs, 2002).  After the patient is hospitalized and weight loss has stopped any number of things could happen next.
These include: receiving intense medical care, restoring a healthy weight, psychotherapy, and medication.
Medical Care
Since those affected by anorexia nervosa can sometimes be is very serious physical condition the patient may require constant monitoring of their vital signs.  Once the patient is in stable condition they may still need a “nasogastric tube” to eat that is placed through the nose and leads to the stomach (mayoclinic.org, 2014).   From this medical care facility the primary care doctor responsible for the patient decides what further action must be taken.  If the case of anorexia nervosa is less severe a mental health care provider will arrange what to do for their patient.
Restoring a Healthy Weight
When a patient with anorexia nervosa is in stable condition they should start to plan on getting back to their healthy weight.  Patients may meet a nutritionist or dietician to learn how to plan a healthy diet (helpguide.org, 2015).  Most of the time they will recommend trying to eat 3 times a day with snacks in between.   They may even prescribe meal plans for the patient to follow.  These meal plans are designed to give enough calories so that the patient is at a healthy weight.  Another factor that can help return a patient to healthy weight is their family, friends, and coworkers.  Having a healthy environment can ensure you return to a healthy weight.
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy is a treatment that helps people with anorexia nervosa by reaching the root of their psychological disorder.  There are 2 types of therapy.  Family based therapy involves parents working with their own children who have the disorder (mayoclinic.org, 2014).  These parents then feed and monitor their weight since they are unable to on their own.  The next therapy is called individual therapy.  Individual therapy involves a patient and a psychiatrist.  The main goal is to train patients to eat regularly and promote healthy eating behaviors (mayoclinic.org, 2014).  Next the psychiatrist tries to help change the patients distorted views about themselves.
Medications
Currently there are no drugs to treat anorexia nervosa because few have been found to be effective.  However, doctors may choose to prescribe antidepressant drugs that can treat mental disorders commonly associated with anorexia nervosa such as depression or anxiety.  Medication coupled with psychotherapy sessions seems to be particularly impactful.

Treatment
There are several treatments for anorexia, including hospitalization, psychotherapy, and medical care. Treatment is usually a “team approach” with the help of the families, doctors, therapists, and nurses. (Treatments and Drugs)
Hospitalization is normally used if the person is in danger from their disease. Hospitals can give liquids to the patient, make sure they are eating, and can regulate the person’s body functions. They are admitted and monitored for changes in their health. People that are admitted usually have reached the point of heart issues, kidney issues, imbalances of their hormones and electrolytes. They can also be admitted for psychiatric problems to help regulate these problems. They begin therapy in the hospital for the disorder and they continue it once they have been discharged from the hospital.
Therapy is another option. If the patient has not reached the point of needing hospitalization then they go into therapy and begin to learn how to treat their illness. Therapists either bring in the families to help with the treatment process or they do it one-on-one. Both focus on how to treat the disorder and try to focus on the patient’s needs. The biggest problems during therapy is helping the person realize that anorexia is an illness and that their weight does not correlate to their self-worth in society. The largest factor to treating anorexia is keeping the person in remission. Many people lose their fight to the illness because they either do not stay in therapy long enough or they feel that they are not supported in their fight.
Influences of Social Media and the Internet
[
]
We are constantly bombarded with images from social media that suggest what the ideal body should look like. Eating disorders continue to rise for both men and women. Pressure comes from sources around us to achieve an unrealistic body type, weight and figure. Constant connection to social media can worsen this problem for some individuals.
Anorexia is an eating disorder that many people struggle with every day. It is considered a psychological disorder and can require a variety of therapies to overcome it. Consider the number of people that have been diagnosed with anorexia or those that face symptoms of the disease. Then, think of the number of these people that use the Internet everyday. Most people do not realize it, but Internet and social media sites play a big role in the lives of those with anorexia.
Social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr often show photo of young men and women with bony, at times emaciated, bodies apparently glamorizing the disease. The Internet beautifies the ideals of eating disorders with these images. These sites are what teenagers and young adults use everyday and these types of photos add pressure to look a certain way. After seeing these pictures, many young people strive to attain these body types and it’s not healthy. In addition to social media sites, there are “pro-ana” websites. These websites are created in support of anorexia.
According to Mansour (2013), pro-ana websites glorify the dangerous weight loss that can occur with anorexia. The article provides direct quotes from a woman who personally struggled with anorexia and the hardships of these pro-ana websites. Mansour then goes on to mention some of the hash tags used with these images such as #thinspiration, #thinspo, #thighgap (Mansour, 2013). These words are what glorify anorexia, like Mansour (2013) mentions. She states, “If you’re at risk of an eating disorder” that these hash tags can trigger “devastating psychological illness” (Mansour, 2013). While these images are glorified by people, reposts and comments, they represent an ugly truth that so many people face in their everyday lives.
One of the biggest issues with these websites is that they possess inaccurate views of anorexia. Pro-ana websites almost applaud those with anorexia making it seem like a lifestyle choice instead of a psychological disorder (Mansour, 2013). The sites provide environments where there is constant competition (Mansour, 2013) in the same way social media outlets do. Another article titled “Totally In Control” taken from the Social Issues Research Centre directly quotes a pro-ana website that states: “‘This is a site for those who already have an eating disorder and do not wish to go into recovery’” (“Totally In Control”). This demonstrates that there are websites that support anorexia in such a way where it is made to seem like people make a conscious decision to be anorexic.
Another problem with these sites is that they do not offer help to those suffering. Instead, they reinforce a behavior that is unhealthy and detrimental to psychological and physiological health. The increasing Internet presence of pro-anorexia websites seems to have increased the presence of the disease in men, as Edmonds discusses in his article. The author mentions that although the disease was once thought to only harm women, researchers have found that the trend is now increasing among men (Edmonds, 2012). The disease tends to be most popular in young people (Edmonds, 2012) and is not something to be taken lightly. There is considerable pressure on young adults today to look a certain way from magazines, televisions shows, and maybe even from friends and family members. The last thing people suffering with anorexia need is another outlet to pressure them.
There will always be people that are unhappy with their bodies. We may not even ever fully eradicate eating disorders. Regardless, removing the pressure added from social media and existing pro-ana websites would certainly make a difference.

Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Bulemia Nervosa
Binge Eating Disorder
Introduction and Background
[
]
Bulimia Nervosa is distinct from anorexia nervosa and it occurs more often than anorexia nervosa.  ‘Bulimia’ is actually derived from the Greek language and means “ox hunger” and “connotes a state in which an individual repetitively consumes a feast-like quantity of food” (Gwirtsman & Mitchell, 2008).  Unlike anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa is less noticeable physically, making it harder to detect (Rolfes & Whitney 2013).  Bulimia nervosa is considered a psychiatric disorder because there is an emotional stress component to the cycle of binge eating and purging (Gwirtsman & Mitchell, 2008).  It is also found to be more common in females than in males, 10:1.  Out of all women, about 2% experience bulimia nervosa during their lifetime (Reus, 2015).  The common typical person that suffers from bulimia nervosa is white, female, single, educated, and within a few pounds of her ideal body weight.  Even people who are a little overweight can suffer from bulimia nervosa (Rolfes & Whitney 2013).
The start of this disorder normally begins in adolescence and can last for any number of years depending on the individual.  Dieting is often a precursor to bulimia nervosa and can be seen to lead to the cycles of out of control eating and compensating actions.  These cycles occur about once a week for 3 months at a time and both the binge eating and the compensatory behaviors have to be present in order for the patient to be diagnosed with bulimia nervosa (Radin, Ranzenhofer, & Tanofsky-Kraff, 2015).  The secrecy of bulimia nervosa is caused by an obsession with thinking about their body image and food.  People who suffer from bulimia nervosa have multiple episodes of binge eating that are followed by actions that compensate for the excessive eating, like laxatives, purging, enemas, or extensive exercise (Reus, 2015).
A bulimic binge is where an individual feels they do not have control over what they are eating and will not have a gauge of how much they are eating or what they are eating.  Often, this occurs because it acts as an action that brings about emotional comfort.  The purge part of the cycle can be done by either a cathartic or an emetic.  A cathartic is a very strong laxative that has the ability to injure part of the lower intestinal tract.  On the other hand, an emetic can be used to help induce vomiting and is a drug intended to combat poisoning.  The consequences of this vicious cycle are mineral imbalances, abnormal heart rhythms, and battered kidneys.  Vomiting can cause sores in the mouth, dental caries and erosion of the teeth, and callused hands.  Not only are there physical consequences, but there are also mental consequences and effects.  After the purge, the individual often feels ashamed or guilty.  Treatment for bulimia nervosa includes establishing a regular eating planned schedule and a regular exercise regimen.  Maintaining a healthy weight is key to recovering from bulimia nervosa (Rolfes &Whitney 2013).
Overview and Definition
[
]
Bulimia Nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder in which episodes of binge eating (the consumption of large quantities of food in a short period of time) are met with behaviors utilized in an attempt to lose weight. Those who binge often don’t have any feeling of control during their binging episodes. According to the updated DSM-V, to be diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa, the minimum  frequency of “binge-purge” incidents needed is once a week. Many people suffering from Bulimia Nervosa usually partake in these activities more often than this.
There are actually two categories of Bulimia Nervosa:
• (1) Purging Bulimia Nervosa: This is a form that uses physical methods to actually rid oneself of the binged food. Examples of purging include vomiting or the use of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.
• (2) Non-purging Bulimia Nervosa: This is a form that uses methods such as excessive exercise, fasting, or dieting to prevent weight gain from the previous binge eating. Many people tend to overlap with these two separate categories of Bulimia Nervosa, using dangerous weight loss methods from both.
Approximately 1.5% of women and 0.5% of men suffer from Bulimia Nervosa at some point in their life. Women are much more likely to develop bulimia nervosa, but it should not be forgotten that it still occurs in males as well. It is also more prominent in certain populations, especially college students.  Bulimia Nervosa can be life threatening due to the physical effects that it takes on one’s body. It also has a mortality rate of approximately 3.9%.
Signs and Symptoms
[
]
Symptoms commonly associated with Bulimia Nervosa include:
• Self-esteem issues relating to body image
• Episodes of binge eating followed by purging (at least once a week)
• Changes in personality/social behavior
• Extreme fear of gaining weight
• Feelings of loss of control pertaining to food consumption
Signs that someone may be suffering from Bulimia Nervosa:
• Constant negativity about one’s body image/weight
• Possible fluctuations in weight (however, people suffering with Bulimia typically do not gain large amounts of weight)
• Evidence of possible binge eating (wrappers, empty containers, etc.)
• Unnecessary trips to the restroom after meals (occurs often)
• Avoiding meals, especially in social settings
• Hiding or hoarding food
• Symptoms of depression or anxiety
• Fatigue
Criteria needed to diagnose Bulimia Nervosa (According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition):
• Frequent episodes of binge eating
• Compensating “purging” behaviors to prevent weight gain from binge eating
•Episodes of binging and purging must occur at least once a week for at least three months
•Very self-aware about body shape and/or weight
•Episodes do not occur solely during episodes of anorexia nervosa
Causes
[
]
Bulimia Nervosa can be caused by a number of factors, but these factors typically revolve around one’s psychological wellbeing. A person with Bulimia Nervosa has a fear of gaining weight, desperately wants to lose weight, or is simply extremely unhappy/uncomfortable with their body. This unhappiness can stem from bullying, social media, comparison to others, or real psychological disorders such as body dysmorphia, depression, and anxiety.
There are many factors that come into play when talking about what causes bulimia, although an exact cause has not been determined and some of them having been mentioned above. Certain situations that could cause a person to develop bulimia nervosa include: previous trauma/abuse, stressful life changes and even culture. Many people who suffer or have suffered from bulimia have a history of abuse, whether it is physical, emotional or sexual. A person with an abusive history could be left with lasting psychological trauma, leaving them to feel as though binging and purging is the only thing they could control. Some people with eating disorders have a ‘coping skills deficit.’ Traumatic events may affect those at risk differently than those not at risk, which could cause the development of an eating disorder. So, instead of dealing with things such as depression and anxiety by using positive coping skills, they resort to actions such as binging and purging. There are also a high percentage of athletes that suffer from eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa. Sports that put a lot of emphasis on appearance or muscularity could put certain athletes at risk. Some examples of these types of sports include: gymnastics, wrestling, etc. Biology also comes into play. While this hasn't proved to be a direct cause, some say genetics could play a big role. Those with first-degree relatives suffering from an eating disorder have an increased chance of developing one themselves, 7-12% more likely. It has also been said that a decreased level of serotonin in the brain could also be linked with the development of bulimia nervosa. Another cause of bulimia nervosa could be sociocultural ideals. Currently, our media has increased people’s obsession with the “perfect body” therefore contributing to unrealistic body ideals, which really negatively harm people. While it may not be possible to say that social media directly causes an eating disorder, those who are considered at risk of developing an eating disorder could be increasingly vulnerable to these ideals.  Another contributing factor to developing an eating disorder is the notion of ‘dieting.’ This country has made a $60 billion industry off of dieting and dieting products. One of the major factors of dieting that could be a cause of bulimia nervosa is that it instills a feeling of guilt and shame in relation to food. Because many diets emphasize restrictive eating, people often come to associate food with negative thoughts. “Should I be eating this right now?” or “No I already had carbs this morning, I can’t eat anymore now.” When dieting is gone about the wrong way, it could have the potential to lead to developing an eating disorder like bulimia nervosa. As it was mentioned before, a single cause of bulimia nervosa has not yet been discovered, however all of these factors play a large role in causing it.
Effects
[
]
Although the causes of bulimia are mostly psychological, the effects can be as well. This eating disorder can cause the person to be even unhappier with their body than they originally were, thus increasing the levels of depression and anxiety that may in turn promote isolation and a feeling of emptiness. In addition, one is being forced to combat the physical effects. These physical conditions include dental problems, gastrointestinal issues, and vitamin, nutrient, and electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances can be life threatening since they cause damage to the heart and other major systems of the body. The persistent purging behavior acts as the major catalyst to these issues due to the fact that the highly acidic stomach acid in vomit corrodes the lining of the esophagus as well as tooth enamel, leading to tooth decay and bad breath (National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA]). Purging also flushes out the major nutrients the body needs to be healthy, such as vitamins A, B, B12, C, D, E, K, and folic acid (Liberty, 2011). These deficiencies each trigger their own sets of issues. The misuse of medications to induce vomiting or to expedite waste movement causes damage to the muscles of the bowel system and can result in both constipation and diarrhea.
Bulimia Nervosa vs. Anorexia Nervosa
[
]
Bulimia Nervosa is a dangerous eating disorder. One of the main diagnostic criterions for bulimia nervosa from the DSMV-IV is eating in large amounts then purging (Fairburn & Brownell, 2005). This binging then purging is mostly used to prevent weight gain after consuming large amounts of food. The initial red flag of bulimia is the binging. Another red flag is possible self-induced vomiting after meals. This can be evident if a person makes frequent trips to the restroom after meals. There is often a feeling of no control when a person is binging, as if they absolutely have to keep eating. This then leads to a feeling of shame or regret, and in order to not gain any weight or any other supposed effects of eating all the food, the affected purges.
Purging can come in many forms; although, a lot of the time it is associated only with self- induced vomiting. Purging by definition means to rid one self of something undesirable. In a bulimic’s case, what is undesired is the calories or fats associated with eating large amounts of food- or really any amount of food. However, within bulimia nervosa, there are two types defined by the Mayo Clinic (“Bulimia Nervosa,” 2015). Purging bulimia is when the affected regularly makes themselves throw up, or they overuse laxatives or diuretics in order to rid their body quickly of food they have just consumed. Non-purging bulimia is when they use other methods to get rid of the calories like strenuous exercise, dieting, or fasting. Purging itself is caused by the patient’s psychological need to rid the body of any amount food that could have been consumed.
Non-purging bulimia can be mistaken for anorexia nervosa because of the fasting or excessive exercise, but the main difference is that anorexia is associated with a fear of gaining weight, and often leads to weight loss that is extremely severe. Many people with bulimia could be around normal weight. A person can exhibit symptoms of both anorexia and bulimia, but when a person is underweight and begins to purge, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa stands to be more important, and this would remain their primary diagnosis. The psychological need to compensate for consuming such large amounts of food stems from the person’s image of himself or herself. This cycle is the most telling sign of bulimia. Patients often diet, but break it and binge eat, and then the purging follows in order to make up for the lapse in the diet.
Both eating disorders are associated with an over valuing of skinniness, and dissatisfaction with a person’s own body. They are very much affected by the personality of the person and the environment they live in. If a person is very preoccupied with how they look to begin with, and someone in their surroundings begins to be a little hard on them, this could certainly make a person very susceptible to starting these behaviors and developing an eating disorder. To cure bulimia, intensive therapy and medication is needed. The University of Maryland Medical Center suggests that they must rebuild their physical and mental health in order to be truly cured of their eating disorder (Ehrlich, 2014). A patient must be able to break the cycle of binging and purging, and to do this, the patient must rid himself or herself of the need to be thin or lose weight. After this, they can then work on rebuilding the nutrients that they have been purging themselves of.
Treatment
[
]
Nutrition plays a pivotal mark in the recovery of someone with bulimia. It provides the opportunity to become better educated about food, teaching the benefits of certain foods, or allows one to change they way they think about food (Lambert, 2015). Changing eating habits goes a long way in this process:
Follow the Recommended Daily Allowances for foods along with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for macronutrients
Avoid fatty foods or saturated fats from processed foods because these foods contain large amounts of fat, sodium, and cholesterol and increase the risk of fat build-up,     which moreover makes the person feel bad about their body
Eat a fairly even amount of carbohydrates, the body’s main source of energy, fruits and vegetables, and dairy and protein.
Encourage fiber-rich carbohydrates that cause immediate feelings of being full and foods that provide protein and fat for satiety
Plan meals and snacks and record the plans prior to eating
In addition, plan meals and snacks that require eating at the table and using utensils and avoid eating finger foods.
Eat a well-balanced diet and regularly timed meals
Consume adequate amounts of fluids but especially water
Establishing a regular eating pattern is also important
Seeking a nutritionist is essential in establishing goals for the patient to meet and allows them to work to a healthy weight
Instead of focusing on weight loss or weight gain, those seeking treatment should focus on weight maintenance. Major steps toward recover include discontinuing purging and restrictive dieting habits and learning to eat three meals a day plus snacks. (Rolfes, Whitney 2013)
In addition to focusing on changing the mindset about nutrition those affected by bulimia nervosa should also undergo psychiatric therapy. The largest controlled study supports that “Tailored cognitive behavioral therapy and, to some extent, interpersonal psychotherapy can help young women stop bingeing and purging, accept their appearance, and develop healthier ways of coping with stressful situations” (DeAngelis, 2002).  Cognitive behavioral therapy is extremely useful is working through emotional crises. This can be used to overcome several obstacles that could be the root cause of Bulimia Nervosa. Therapists encourage the client to talk about the problems related to the eating disorder but in a non-directive manner. This type of therapy helps the person affected to become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so that they can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way. (Mayo Clinic. 2016). Individual therapy can also build awareness of one’s own feelings and help them gain independence from others. It is extremely important to the process to learn more adaptive ways to think about food and its relationship to the body. Those affected are taught how to monitor their food intake, introducing avoided foods into diet, and coping techniques for avoiding bingeing. They are taught to accurately read sensations of hunger and satiety. In-patient therapy can also be used in extreme cases. This allows the patient to be uninfluenced by their environment and really focus on achieving their health goals. Having support and being surrounded by those going through the same situation can help with the healing process. A nutritionist at the facility can lead groups, help establish meal plans, keep track of the calories consumed. A therapist there can hold individual and group sessions. Antidepressants can also be useful when treating bulimia. They can reduce bingeing and vomiting as well as enhance their sense of control.

Bulemia Nervosa
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Binge Eating Disorder
Non-categorized Eating Disorder
As defined by the Mayo Clinic, binge-eating disorder is a serious condition in which a person frequently compulsively overeats and feels powerless and unable to stop eating. Binge-Eating Disorder (B.E.D) cannot be self-diagnosed and people who think they have B.E.D should see a health care provider who can diagnose this medical condition when the specific criteria are met Persons that fit this criterion are often embarrassed about their overeating but are unfortunately unable to resist the urges to eat and continue on a pattern of overeating.
Out of all eating disorders that adults can suffer from, Binge Eating Disorder is the most prevalent. According to a national survey, B.E.D has an effect on 2.8 million adults, which makes it more prevalent in young adults than both bulimia and anorexia combined. While this disorder affects both men and women, women are two times more affect than men by B.E.D (What is binge eating disorder, 2015). B.E.D also does not discriminate based on race.  Binge Eating Disorder is and often is associated with illnesses that are linked to obesity, poor quality of life, eating disorder psychopathology, and poor functioning in society (Turan, Poyraz & Özdemir, 2015).  This condition is also found to be linked to suicidal ideation and associated with other eating disorders (Lipsky & McGuinness, 2015).
The DSM-5 defines binge eating episodes as fitting along with at least three of these descriptions (APA, 2013):
•	Eating more quickly than what is considered normal
•	Eating until one feels extremely full to the point that it is uncomfortable
•	Eating a large amount even when not feeling physically hungry
•	Eating alone due to embarrassment about the amount of food that one is consuming
•	Experiencing feelings of disgust with themselves, depression, or guilt after eating
In addition to meeting that criteria, the DSM-5 states that in order for to be diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder, one must have frequent and persistent episodes of binge eating, experience stress in regards to binge eating, and have the absence of behaviors that are compensatory, like purging, for example. Frequent binge eating episodes are defined as once per week for three consecutive months.
What is Binge Eating Disorder?
[
]
Binge eating disorder is a mental health condition consisting of extensive episodes of compulsive eating. Binges can be characterized by rapidly eating large quantities of food periodically, while being unable to stop oneself due to loss of control or feelings of numbness. Individuals may binge on and off all day, however, one episode could last up to two hours.Many people with B.E.D eat when they are not hungry and continue to eat for a long time way after they feel full. Binges allow a person to feel comfort for a brief period of time, until they come back to reality with social stigmas, which create feelings of regret and distress. In addition, people suffering from compulsive eating often eat alone or in secret. Although BED is severe and life threatening, it is treatable with the proper help.
The History of Binge Eating Disorder
Binge Eating Disorder (BED) was not considered a psychiatric disorder until recent years. The first record of any BED episode was recorded by psychiatrist Albert Stunkard in 1959. At this time the disorder was coined for eating during the night. Twenty-eight years later in 1987, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) associated binge eating with the already-known eating disorder, Bulimia. The APA mentioned binge eating in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This is an important step in defining the disorder because people were then able to obtain medical treatment for the condition. In 1994 the APA increased awareness for BED by listing “binge eating” in the appendix of the DSM-4 under “eating disorder not otherwise specified.” As binge eating disorder rapidly became recognized as a psychiatric illness, a nonprofit called Binge Eating Disorder Association was started in 2008. This organization took a stand as a support group for people struggling with BED while running several events and a conference every year. In 2013 the APA gave BED its own section under eating disorders in the DSM-5. This is an important step as insurance plans could now cover treatment for BED. In January 2015, drug treatment for BED was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) is the drug to be used. Studies performed by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that 50 to 70 milligrams was an appropriate dosage.
Risk Factors
[
]
•	Family history
•	Psychological issues- negative feelings about skills and accomplishments for oneself. Triggers can include stress, poor body self image, food and boredom
•	Dieting
•	Age- binge eating disorder often begins in the late teens or early twenties (although can occur at any age)
•	Biological abnormalities-

Characteristics of Binge-Eating Disorder
[
]
Binge-eating disorder can be associated with physical, emotional, and behavioral characteristics that make identifying a subject of the disorder more clearly.
Physical characteristics include:
Variation of body weight. Weight can fluctuate from normal to mild, then from mild to overweight, then from overweight to obese.
Weight gain is not always associated with binge-eating disorder. There is an elevated correspondence between those who binge and the characteristic of being overweight however, not everyone with binge-eating disorder is overweight.
Emotional characteristics include:
Dissatisfaction with one’s body image or body size. This can sometimes be traced back to the subject being the subject of bullying in childhood due to their body size or a specific characteristic regarding their physical appearance.
Dissatisfaction with one’s body image or body size. This can sometimes be traced back to the subject being the subject of bullying in childhood due to their body size or a specific characteristic regarding their physical appearance.
Depression is a common occurrence and cause of those who experience the impulse to binge.
Common among binge-eating disorder and many other eating disorders is the need to be in control and a desire for perfectionism.
•One of the biggest causes of binge eating disorder, is the inability to manage ones emotions, especially negative emotions like stress or depression
Behavioral characteristics include:
Binge-eaters are often very secretive when it comes time for them to binge. They often eat in places where they will not be found or seen such as eating alone or in their car. In an effort to be secretive, these subjects tend to hide food wrappers or empty containers that held their food. They will also hide or hoard food for later use.
Binge-eaters do not exhibit normal eating patterns. They will often skip meals, engage in repetitive dieting or fasting, not planning meals but rather eating constantly throughout the day, and sometimes will only eat a certain food group for an extended period of time. If they do eat in front of other, they will eat normally and then later binge later when they are by themselves
They often create scheduled times throughout their day to allow for themselves to binge-eat.
Eating way beyond the point of feeling uncomfortably full. These periods of eating are usually impulse driven, uncontrolled, and continuous.
Will not purge following a binge-eating session.

Binge Eating Disorder affects 3.5% of adult women, 2% of adult men, and 1.6% of children and adolescents (Marx, 2013).  This disorder usually affects women in their early adult life, while men will be affected mostly in the middle of their life. Two- thirds of people that have binge eating disorder are obese, as well, which causes them to suffer from other medical problems, as a result (Marx, 2013).
Physical and Psychological Effects
[
]
Physical Effects
Physical effects of binge eating disorder can be both short term and long term. Although individuals who are obese do not have binge eating disorder, those struggling with binge eating disorder can become obese or heavier than their average weight.  However, most physical health risks for binge eating disorder are associated with clinical obesity. This includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, gall bladder disease, fatigue, joint pain (knees and hips), and sleep apnea (breathing that stops many times during the night).
The health risks that result from binge eating disorder, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels, can result in even greater physical issues that can eventually lead to traumatic events such as a heart attack or stroke. It is so important to deal with Binge Eating Disorder early on to prevent these serious effects from taking place.
Psychological Effects
While many physical and psychological effects of binge eating disorder can go hand-in-hand, many psychological effects are a domino effect of one another. Effects of compulsive eating include feelings of distress, shame and guilt. Compared to individuals who do not have binge eating disorder, those suffering report a lower quality of life, and increased levels of anxiety and depression throughout their life. Overwhelming feelings of stress or tension may arise and can only be relieved by eating. Consequently, individuals may possess embarrassment over the amount one eats, lacking satisfaction despite the amount of food previously consumed, along with guilt, disgust and or depression. These psychological effects can also cause social conflicts such as significant desperation to control eating habits and body weight, loneliness and isolation. The more social conflicts individuals experience such as loneliness, guilt and isolation, the greater the chances are of continuing to binge and the lower the changes are of stopping.
Treatment
[
]
Along with therapy for binge eating disorder, it is also important to set goals and make some lifestyle changes in order to overcome the desire to binge.  Some important things to learn are how to manage stress, exercise, get sufficient amount of sleep each night, and refrain from dieting. Exercise is important because exercise can help to improve your self-body image and it can always be a good outlet to relieve stress. Meal planning plays a crucial role in BED treatment because it allots specific times to eat. This includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and healthy snacks sporadically throughout the day. Aside from meal planning, it is beneficial to monitor the types of food that is found within an individual’s home. Instead of purchasing junk food and candy, which are tempting foods to binge on, recovering individuals should choose healthy foods in their homes. Individuals battling B.E.D should also find ways to overcome their boredom Instead of going to food when they have nothing to do, having a plan and other activities can stop those who binge eat when they are bored. It is also very important to understand your body and know the difference between emotional and physical hunger. Physical hunger is when your body needs food in order to support activities within the body and emotional hunger is when people look for food to temporarily solve their problems (Smith, Segal & Segal 2016). Professional help can come from therapists, who can help in a number of ways including cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and dialectical behavior therapy.
Not only can altering one’s diet and eating habits treat Binge Eating Disorder, but there are additional ways to handle this disorder, as well. Binge Eating Disorder has been treated using medications or pharmacotherapy. For example, they have treated this disorder using drugs that also treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This disorder can also be treated using psychotherapy, which can come in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy (Marx, 2013).  It has been treated through surgery to the stomach or intestines, in order to help with weight loss  (Turan, Poyraz & Özdemir, 2015).
How to Help Someone With Binge-Eating Disorder
[
]
One of the first steps in helping someone with this disorder is voicing your concern of their problem to them. It is quite common for a subject of Binge-Eating Disorder to become defensive, angry, or deny the issue when confronted and it may take time for them to open up to discuss their struggles with food (Smith, 2015). Encouraging them to seek help can show that you are there for support and that there are other people out there who can help cure B.E.D.
Do not give up on the person you are trying to help. Defensive actions often mean they are having trouble admitting they have a problem. Be aware of signs or habits that the person struggling with BED is returning to their old ways such as empty food containers, wrappers, cabinets, refrigerators, and any hidden stashes of food they are likely to binge on. If the person does, assure them that it is okay and recovery is possible. Binge eaters are already struggling with shame and guilt, so avoid lecturing them about any setbacks that may occur. Always provide supportive words and supportive actions even if they take a step back in their progress. Try to keep nutritious foods in the house and not unhealthy snacks that will tempt bingeing and remind them of old habits. Adapt a healthy lifestyle yourself including the right foods and frequent exercise to set a positive example for the person struggling with BED. Do not hesitate to seek counseling from a professional for yourself as helping someone with any psychiatric disorder can give rise to stress and requires a grounded mindset.

Binge Eating Disorder
Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
Non-categorized Eating Disorder
Nutrition and Mental Health
Many times when someone has an eating disorder, it is categorized into Anorexia or Bulimia. The problem with this is that every person is different and experiences a variety of symptoms that may not fit perfectly into the known major eating disorders. In 1987, under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R, 1987), Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) was introduced to specify a group of eating disorders that were not previously recognized. According to The Center for Eating Disorders, EDNOS accounted for about 40-60% of eating disorder cases in treatment centers.
In 2013, the DSM-V was published with a new change in regards to EDNOS. More eating disorders were individually recognized like Binge Eating Disorder as well as Purging Disorder and Night Eating Syndrome being classified disordered eating behaviors. The biggest change was the switch from EDNOS to Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED). This change was made to be able to include the growing variety of disordered eating and feeding behaviors. OSFED now includes 5 main subtypes:
1.	Atypical Anorexia Nervosa
2.	Bulimia Nervosa
3.	Binge Eating Disorder
4.	Purging Disorder
5.	Night Eating Syndrome
6. Nocturnal Eating Disorders
Even though these categories have potential to become narrow like the original eating disorders, DSM-V added in a category called Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (UFED). The main goal of all the changes made over the years is to open up the field of disorders and the minds of people to understand that individuals suffering from a disorder not well known or specifically defined, are acknowledged and then given the opportunity to seek appropriate medical help.
Cases that may fall into one of the above categories include all of the symptoms for anorexia being met except for presence of a regular menstrual cycle or the individual weight is within normal ranges. Another case of OSFED could be someone who meets all of the general criteria for bulimia but doesn’t engage in binging or purging behaviors as often to be classified as a bulimic. There are also individuals known to purge after only eating small or normal amounts of food instead of fully binging then purging, as well as staying within normal weight ranges. In addition, some individuals will chew and spit out large amounts of their food without swallowing it. All of these are a little more commonly exhibited and recorded in the eating disorder world but do not include the every possible case or situation that may occur among an individual fighting a disorder.
Orthorexia
Orthorexia Defined
Although orthorexia is not considered a legitimate eating disorder, there are many people who overanalyze the foods they eat and do not consume anything that is unhealthy or impure. This includes any kind of food that has been processed, such as whole grain bread. Some orthorexics may even stray away from eating certain food groups, which can lead to the chain reaction of continuously removing more and more types of food. Just as anorexics have a strong desire to be thin, orthorexics have a strong desire to be healthy. People suffering from anorexia worry about the quantity of the foods they consume whereas orthorexics are concerned about the quality. Individuals with orthorexia start off simply trying to eat healthier but it progresses and they become so fixated on ‘I must eat healthily or nothing at all’. Orthorexics are so obsessed with eating healthy that, ironically, it actually causes their health to decline.
Symptoms
Spending a great deal of time thinking about the food quality of the next meal
Being so fixated on eating only healthy foods that are organic or whole that it interferes with daily activities.
Refusing to eat foods not prepared by oneself due to the possibility that the ingredients are unhealthy.
Not wanting to eat in social settings (thus causing one to be antisocial) because the food isn’t healthy.
Placing oneself on a pedestal and looking down on others for not having a “healthy” diet like them.
Feeling remorseful when not following a healthy diet, but feeling in control when they do.
Treatment
Acceptance: The first step in treating individuals with orthorexia is for the orthorexics themselves to accept the fact that their compulsive urge to eat healthy is a threat to their health.
Origin: Once the patients acknowledge that it is a problem, they must figure out what it was that caused them to develop their unhealthy obsession.
Therapy: Orthorexics should be open to seeing a nutritionist or dietician, psychologist, or even a therapist. Because disorders are not something one can control, seeking assistance to guide these patients in the right direction is very beneficial. Orthorexics already feel isolated to begin with and requesting help from experts is a large step for them. For those reasons, it is crucial that the patient’s family members and the professional treating the patient speak to the patient with composure and understanding rather than an accusatory tone.
Recovery: A recovered orthorexic will still have the impulse to eat healthily, but it will not be so severe that it will conflict with their day-to-day living.
Drunkorexia
Drunkorexia Defined
Although drunkorexia is also not considered a legitimate eating disorder, it has been given this official name by researches after many studies were done and many results showed a connection between binge drinking and either self-starvation or purging. Many people, especially college-aged students, engage in this type of behavior and drunkorexia can be seen as an uncategorized eating disorder. Drunkorexia has been more specifically characterized by
1.	Skipping meals so that the calories of from drinking will be compensated for.
2.	Over-exercising so that the calories from drinking do not cause weight gain.
3.	Drink massive amounts of alcohol, causing ones-self to become sick and purge food that was eaten previously.
It has also been stated in a study done on binge drinking that there are a few covariates for this study such as gender, age, race, year in college, place of residence, and greek membership.
So, there are many different variables that come into play when looking at this correlation. It is clear that there is a connection between disordered eating, or physical activity, to “offset calories consumed from drinking”. This eating disorder can closely resemble anorexia nervosa, with the relationship of excessive exercise or restriction of foods, because of the fear of gaining weight and body image (Barry).
Non-categorized eating disorders, also known as Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified, are made for those who have a lot of the symptoms of specific eating disorders but do not meet all of the criteria to be diagnosed in one section. A lot of times people with non-categorized eating disorders even meet the criteria for multiple eating disorders at the same time. It is also one of the largest groups of eating disorders because the criterion is not as specific as the ones for anorexia or bulimia. Actually, “about 40%-60% of cases in eating disorder treatment centers fell into the Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified Category” (A closer look). The significance or gravity of the cases can be decided through the patters of behaviors and symptoms.
→Much like other diseases there are “various physical, psychological, and behavioral warning signs that can signal the onset” (Understanding the warning signs, 2015) and help should be sought as soon as possible. Significant weigh loss, loss of energy and behavioral warnings like rituals or evidence of binge eating, excessive dieting, or vomiting should not be taken lightly. The most notable characteristics of non-categorized eating disorders are distorted body image, being afraid of gaining weight, and disordered eating. n Although there are plenty of physical signs of eating disorders, there are significant behavioral patterns that would point to the eating disorder. A lot of times, people with eating disorders will eat meals alone, frequently use the bathroom right after meals, abuse laxatives, and change their appearance. More importantly there are also psychological signals like being preoccupied about their body image, feelings of distress and anxiety when it comes to food, and constantly fueling the idea of self-punishment.
→Like other mental disorders, eating disorders not otherwise specified also come with major risks that could eventually lead to death. The risks that come with eating disorders not otherwise specified are not that much different from the complications and results that come with anorexia or bulimia. Some of the physical risks are the rupturing of the esophagus, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and ever infertility in both men and women. Eating disorders are usually tied to other mental issues like low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. They can also cause significant stress on families, relationships and friendships. The person becomes so preoccupied with food, its almost like the eating disorder has taken control. It starts to leave no room for hobbies, hanging out, or even happiness. Even with all of the risks and warning behaviors, there is hope for treatment. It just takes the right support, base, and knowledge. “Having awareness about eating disorders and the warning signs can make a marked difference to the severity and duration of the illness” (Eating disorders explained, 2014).
→Although we know a lot about most eating disorders, eating disorders not specified are more vaguely defined and discussed. It is much more difficult to find much data on non-categorized eating disorders because they usually are not included in studies like those done on anorexia or bulimia.
Athletes With Eating Disorders
text
A lot of athletes are looked at for potentially dangerous eating behaviors. They are participating in regularly scheduled exercise and high intensity work outs. They require lots of physical activity to play at their best. A lot of athletes proceed to want to be the best at what they do which requires to be as fit as possible. Due to the nature of the athlete, excessive exercise and restrictive eating are often viewed as acceptable in athletic training.
	Athletes with eating disorders sometimes get overlooked due to the nature of their sport. Some people think that they are training harder because they want to be able to get a scholarship or to win a game or other factors that are in play.
	Personality traits among athletes are high achievement motivation, perfectionism, obsessive compulsive tendencies, and persistence toward goals despite pain or discomfort. They are willing to take risks in order to win.
	There is a general population of 3% of exercise addiction. There are also different populations where it is seen more than others, such as ultra- marathon runners and sports science students.
	Exercise additions appears to be related to food disorders, overuse of caffeine, work addiction and shopping addiction. Due to the nature of the addiction, exercise addiction co- occurs with eating disorder which is extremely dangerous. There is also a challenge for professionals to treat both additions. Making sure they take care of both disorders is a challenge that professionals have to face while dealing with athletes from suffering this disorder.
	A lot of coaches could also influence the chance of an athlete contracting this type of eating disorder. They are on top of athletes to make sure they are in shape and eating right in order to fit a certain body image.
	A sport that is high in eating disorders is dancers. A lot of dancers rely on their body image to be light enough and small enough to do certain moves and carries. Dancers have been found to have one of the highest amount of eating disorders of any sport.
	There are a lot of other sports that body weight is a major contributor to performance. Weight lifting requires both male and females to be classified into a specific weight class. This requires the athletes to keep close watch on their weight.
	There are sports that their performance is subjectively scored for their appearance, such as figure skating. Jockeying requires the athlete to be smaller in size due to the horse not being able to run as fast with someone heavier.
Night Eating Syndrome
Night eating syndrome(NES) is not like a binge eating disorder, however, the two may cross within certain individuals. The amount of food consumed does not necessarily have to be large, it can be of any quantity. A loss of control as with binge eating is also not required. Most individuals with this syndrome are often binge eaters, and can have a loss of control over food intake as well.
NES was originally described in 1955 by Dr. Albert Stunkard. NES affects around 1.5 percent of the population, and is equally common in both men and women. It is currently included in the “Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder” category. Most individuals with night eating syndrome may feel as though they have little to no control over their irregular eating patterns, and can feel humiliation and discomfort over their condition.
Individuals with NES can be overweight, feel ashamed, and eat in secret or when they are not hungry. These individuals will eat the majority of their food in the evening and at night as the name of the syndrome suggests. They will consume almost nothing in the daylight hours, and will wake-up in the middle of the night to pursue high calorie snacks.
The causes of NES vary, but as with other eating disorders, may arise as a result of shame and discomfort. It can also arise from bad habits, such as eating late at night, or working through lunches and dinners. It may even be a response to stress or hormones causing these individuals to not eat when they should, and to eat when they normally should not. It may also be caused in response to bad dieting techniques, restricting oneself on calories signals the brain later in the evening that the body is still hungry, resulting in consumption during a time when the body should be at rest. It may also result from late-night cravings.
The treatment of NES typically requires many therapies as with any other eating disorder. First the individual affected must be educated about their condition so that they may become more aware that their eating patterns are not normal. They must also be made aware that they are not at fault, and be given support as they take steps towards recovery. Treatment includes nutrition assessment, exercise therapy, behavioral therapy, and along with therapy, stress management. The individual must also be willing to change their beliefs and behavior associated with NES if they truly hope to be able to change.

Nocturnal Eating Disorders
Nocturnal eating disorders are classified as abnormal eating patterns during the night and consist of two categories, Sleep-Related Eating Disorder and Nocturnal Eating Syndrome. Nocturnal Eating Disorders were discovered in 1955 in 25 patients with obesity. Nocturnal Eating Disorders are considered both eating disorders and sleeping disorders and may be amplified by other eating disorders of sleep disorders.
Sleep Related Eating Disorder: Classified as preparing and eating food while unconscious and unaware. Will wake up the next morning with no memory of eating or preparing food and may be confused as to why there is food out of the refrigerator.
•	Signs of Sleep Related Eating Disorder
o	Seeing food left out on counter upon waking
o	Little or no appetite in the morning
o	Weight gain
Nocturnal Eating Syndrome: This differs from Sleep Related Eating Disorder in that these patients are fully aware that they are eating. They may be woken up in the middle of the night and find themselves unable to fall asleep unless they eat. Usually the foods consumed are large amounts of unhealthy foods
•	Signs of Nocturnal Eating Syndrome
o	Frequently waking at night and must eat in order to sleep
o	Eat more food after dinner than during dinner
o	Little or no appetite for breakfast
Causes and Effects: may cause weight gain, depression, hypertension, and increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes
•	Found in 5% of the population
•	More common in women
•	More common in women under 50
•	More common in obese population
•	Risk increased to 17% if tied to other eating disorders
•	Risk increased to 27% in the severely obese community
•	Dieting during the day may lead to hunger at night
•	May be caused by alcoholism, drug abuse and other sleeping disorders
•	May be a precursor to a larger medical problem such as stomach ulcers, sleep apnea, depression, bulimia, sleep walking, or a traumatic event
•	Zolpidem (Ambien) can also cause nighttime eating
Treatment: If you think you may have a nocturnal eating disorder contact your doctor or health provider. Initial steps will be an interview to determine your symptoms which maybe be followed by an overnight stay in a sleep lab.
•	Sleeping pills should be avoided and can cause confusion
•	Stress management classes may be advised
•	Counseling
•	Limiting intake of alcohol or caffeine
•	Popiramate (an anti seizure medicine) can treat both syndromes
o	Works on dulling the appetite center of the brain
•	If the cause of the disorder is depression, an anti depressant may be used

Introduction to Depression
Depression is a mental disorder known for decreased mood, appetite, interest in pleasurable activities, and increased anxiety and sadness. Per year, depression affects about 14.8 million Americans over the age of 18 (“Depression Statistics” n.d.). There is some research suggesting that a healthy diet including exercise and increases in certain nutrients can decrease the effects of depression in adults. Conversely, it has been shown that consuming unhealthy diet laden with processed and refined foods was more likely to encourage depressive symptoms (Zeratsky 2015). Nutrition has the possibility of affecting onset, duration, and severity of depression. General dietary intake for Americans and many Asian countries is deficient in a large number of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. A common theme in diets of sufferers of mental illnesses is a severe deficiency of these nutrients. Many different studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of using diet to treat depression, varying between the addition or removal of certain foods from the diet (Rao 2008).
Depression and Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Some studies focus specifically on the addition of fish to the diet, which increases the amount of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), commonly known as omega-3s, present in the diet (Li 2015). The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids provided from fish are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and are sometimes referred to as ‘marine omega-3s’. Omega-3s are an extremely important factor in the body, participating in the regulation of blood clotting through the formation of hormones, artery contraction and relaxation, and inflammation, as well as interact with cells that regulate genetic function (“Omega-3” n.d.). Over time, the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids has declined and reported depression has increased. While this may only reveal correlation and not causation, there are many ways a diet rich in PUFAs could decrease depressive symptoms. One theory suggests that the conversion of EPA to various chemicals such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins may cause the antidepressant effect, while another states that the effect of DHA and EPA on brain cell signal transduction may be the reason. Despite the fact that one particular theory has not been proven to result in mood-elevation, many studies have shown that consumption of a dietary supplement is an effective treatment (Lakhan 2008). A study published in September 2015 used previous studies involving the correlations between fish consumption and depression and subsequent meta-analysis to determine whether or not there is meaningful evidence to support fish in treatment of depressive disorder. The study pooled 26 separate studies researching the connection between fish consumption and depression and concluded that high fish consumption could reduce the risk of depression (Li 2015).
Depression and Folate
Other studies have suggested folate as a possible treatment for depression. Simon Young, PHD and professor in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University wrote on how the common theory that serotonin levels play a large role in mood regulation. In his research, he mentions the low ratio of studies on folate deficiency in relation to serotonin production. Due to the generally poor diet of sufferers of depression, folate deficiency is present in one third of patients. In most studies of the subject, neuropsychiatric disorders suggest a correlation between low serotonin levels and folate deficiency. Folate plays a role in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine after demethylating SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine). SAM-e acts as an antidepressant in humans that increases levels of serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (Young). Overall, there are a few different routes to take to treat or supplement treatment of depression. Even if the treatment doesn’t work for a particular patient, a healthier diet can improve quality of life in other aspects.

16.2 Nutrition and Bioactive Compounds
[
]
Bioactive compounds:
A bioactive compound is a chemical found in foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, oils and nuts. It is present in only small amounts and when derived from plants, it is called a phytochemical. These compounds are important in nutrition because they have been found to promote bodily actions that lead to good health while preventing chronic disease. (“Definition” 2015). Based on current research data, bioactive compounds have the potential to prevent heart disease, cancer and other diseases. Many bioactive compounds are antioxidants that quench free radicals in the body. This action prevents cellular and protein destruction. The bioactive properties in berries, tropical fruits and apples have been studied extensively and are believed to have significant health benefits because they contain a variety of phytochemicals. Even though we know the health benefits of bioactive compounds and the result of antioxidant activity in the body, there is still research to be done on their absorption and mechanisms of action that will allow for more comprehensive understanding of bioactive compounds and their future use in medical treatment. (González-Aguilar et al.2008).
Cranberries:
Berries in general have a high concentration of two phytochemicals called flavonoids and anthocyanins that act as antioxidants. The amount of antioxidant found in cranberries depends on factors such as growing season, UV ray intensity, maturity during harvesting, conditions during processing, and storage temperature. There have been multiple studies that show phytochemicals present in cranberries and in other berries have the potential to protect against cancer and cardiovascular disease in addition to possessing anti-inflammatory properties (González-Aguilar et al 2008). In this research, cranberries are distinct from other berry fruits in that their phytochemicals are A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) while most other berries contain B-type PACs. It has been found that A-type PACs might be more effective at maintaining cardiovascular and urinary tract health than B-type PACs (Blumberg et al. 2013).
Cranberries and Urinary Tract Infections:
Recently, there has been specific attention focused on the efficacy of cranberries in decreasing the prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Taking a nutritional path towards UTI treatment as opposed to the traditional antibiotic route has significant long-term benefits to medicine as a whole. Presently, mild antibiotic therapy is used to treat UTIs. Even though it is effective, incomplete or frequent antibiotic treatment leads to the development of resistant strains of bacteria that become increasingly difficult to treat. As a result, stronger and more expensive new antibiotics must be created to fight infection, which is not an easy task.
In trials, cranberry has been the most widely studied successful alternative remedy for UTIs. While this alternative remedy has promise, there are many variables to consider in treatment such as patient population, compliance with medical treatment, and the source or mechanism of infection. Moreover, the ideal dosage of cranberry for treatment is yet to be determined so more research on the topic is needed before it becomes a more understood and mainstream treatment option (Blumberg et al. 2013).
Cranberries and Cardiovascular Health:
There is experimental evidence that supports the idea that cranberries have positive effects on glucose metabolism, blood pressure, cholesterol profile, and inflammation. These factors are crucial in maintaining good cardiovascular health and in preventing complaints such as “atherogenesis, plaque rupture, lesion progression, thrombosis, and myocardial infarction with ischemic cardiomyopathy” (Blumberg et al. 2013).
Cranberries have been shown in animal and human studies to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol leading to improved lipid profiles along with less plaque buildup in the vasculature. The mechanism of this action is not completely understood at this time but it is suggested that cranberry extract may increase the LDL receptor gene expression, leading to increased uptake of LDL into the cells and out of the blood serum. Consequently, the risk for plaque buildup that leads to myocardial infarction, vascular disease, and stroke is decreased with a controlled lipid profile (Blumberg et al. 2013).
Cranberries in the Diet:
Even though they are not usually consumed raw, cranberries can be found in a variety of everyday foods such as:
1.	Sauces
2.	Juice
3.	Dried in cereal or cereal bars
4.	Cheese
5.	Chocolate and other desserts
6.	Cranberry supplements
Due to their tart nature, added sugar is almost always present in cranberry foods. On average, the sugar content of sweetened cranberry juice is approximately 11.7g/100 mL. However, this is less than the 16.5 g/100 mL of sugar found in grape juice. Despite this, with the proper diet cranberry products can fit within the total fat, calorie, saturated fat, sodium and trans fat recommendations in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Blumberg et al. 2013).

Cranberries

Consumption of fruits and veggies has been correlated with a decrease in cardiometabolic risks such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and stroke (Novotny, Baer, Khoo, Gebauer, Charron 2015). The combined percentage of death in 2013 caused by cardiometabolic risks was 32% (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). These diseases are preventable if people are made aware of things they can do to lower these risks and are willing to make those lifestyle changes. The primary things that people need to do in order to changes in their lives are to exercise more often and eat more healthy, nutritious foods.  Consumption of berries, such as cranberries, has many health benefits that will help to lower cardiometabolic risks (Basu, Phone, Lyons 2010).
While it is common knowledge that cranberries help with urinary tract infections, they also contain high concentrations of many bioactive components such as flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins, which have been shown to decrease cardiometabolic risks (Milner, 2002). Flavonoids are antioxidants and inhibit LDL cholesterol and aggregation and adhesion of platelets (Reed, 2002). Platelet aggregation is uncommon in a typical healthy person but is more often found in people with diabetes, smokers, and in patients who suffer from hypertension and elevated levels of LDL. Flavonoids prevent the aggravated platelets from adhering to the sides and walls of the vascular system and thus help decrease the risk for coronary heart disease and stroke by keeping the blood vessels clean and free from extra cholesterol (Reed, 2002). Flavonods are considered to be antioxidants because they help to prevent cancer in patients by absorbing free radicals found in the body (Reed, 2002). Anythocyanins are plant pigments that provide the bright colors in different fruits. In most fruits, they are primarily located in the skin and outer surface but in red fruits, such as cranberries, they are also located throughout the flesh of the fruit (Basu, Phone, Lyons 2010). Anythocyanins, similarly to flavonoids, have been shown to decrease cardiometabolic health risks and are considered an antioxidant. They inhibit the release of activated oxygen from white blood cells, and absorb free radicals typically released from lipid oxidation (Duthie, Jenkinson, Crozier, Mullen, Pirie, Kyle, Yap, Christen, Duthie, 2006). It has also been shown that anythocyanins protect the DNA in the human colon from oxidation and have been successfully used to inhibit tumor cell growth (Duthie, Jenkinson, Crozier, Mullen, Pirie, Kyle, Yap, Christen, Duthie, 2006). The proanthocyanidin in cranberries is what helps with urinary tract infections by preventing bacteria from attaching to mucosal surfaces (Ruel, Couillard, 2007). This substance has also shown to have anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the activation of the destructive enzymes (Ruel, Couillard, 2007).
In conclusion, cranberries contain high concentrations of many different substances that have been proven to decrease cardiometabolic health risks and decrease the risk of cancer through their antioxidant properties. For people looking to improve their health, it is recommend that they eat more fruits and veggies, specifically ones that contain plenty of nutritional value such as antioxidant cranberries.

Mediterranean Diet
[
]
The Mediterranean diet has its basis in the traditional diet of the peoples of Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, Southern Italy, and Crete. During the 1960s researchers discovered that the people who lived in these regions lived longer, healthier lives than Americans even though they had less access to quality health care. After investigation, scientists realized that the difference in health between these two populations was due to diet (Willett et al., 1995). This diet is easy and inexpensive for people to follow. As another bonus, it actually tastes good (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2013)!
The traditional components of a Mediterranean diet are these:
•	Moderate consumption of alcohol (1 glass a day)
•	Seafood at least twice a week
•	Limited consumption of red meat
•	Limited consumption of sweets and dairy
•	Use of olive oil instead of other fats
•	Meals based on fruits, vegetables, and grains instead of meats
•	Use of spices and herbs instead of salt to flavor food
•	Having fresh fruit for desert instead of sweets (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2013).
In addition, the Mediterranean diet places a very high emphasis on sharing meals with friends and family. It is as much a culture as it is a diet. This diet was actually nominated to be an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (Mediterranean diet).
This diet is shown to have myriad health benefits. There is a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cancer, Parkinson’s, and obesity in adults who follow the Mediterranean diet (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2013).
Even though people following this diet receive a majority of their calories from fat, they remain healthy (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016, p. 164). This is because the main fat source of this diet is olive oil. Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat that contains a lot of vitamin E (a natural antioxidant). Studies have shown that eating more monounsaturated fat increases HDL levels while keeping LDL levels constant. This then, obviously, assists in the protective factor of the Mediterranean diet against heart disease (Willett et al., 1995). This diet also advises eating fish at least twice a week. Fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. These omega-3 fatty acids also help to lower the risk of heart disease by decreasing blood triglyceride level, inflammation, and blood pressure (Whitney & Rolfes, 2016, p. 165-166). Also, because of the Mediterranean diet’s emphasis on a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, people following this diet are almost assured to receive all of their necessary micronutrients (Willett et al., 1995).
Sadly, the Mediterranean diet is disappearing from the region it originated in because of globalization and the introduction of the traditional Western diet (An age-old, 2015). The main components of meals are changing to meats and dairy instead of the healthier vegetables and whole grains (Preventing the Mediterranean).

The western diet is known as “The killer”. The Western diet is a diet acknowledged for its lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. This diet is characterized by red meats, fast foods, high sugar beverages, high-fat dairy, and refined carbohydrates.
A typical day on the Western Diet may look like this:
•	Breakfast may consist of a stack of white flour pancakes with a side of sausage, with whole milk and syrup.
•	Lunch might be a fast-food cheeseburger, French fries and a high-sugar soda.
•	Dinner might be fried chicken or meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.
•	Desserts and snacks include potato chips, cookies, ice cream, candy bars and other processed snack foods.
(DietsInReview.com: Leading Diet Review Site, New Healthy Recipes, Breaking Health News)
Although, these foods can be eaten in small portions, the Western Diet is measured by its tremendously large portion sizes, often large enough to feed more than two people. The ingredients usually found in these foods contain high fructose corn syrup, trans fat or partially hydrogenated oils, sugar, bleached grains, enriched flours, food dyes, artificial flavors and many other chemical flavorings that strip foods of nutrients (DietsInReview.com: Leading Diet Review Site, New Healthy Recipes, Breaking Health News).
Studies have shown that the ‘Western diet” can be damaging to a child’s cognitive development, eventually hindering their academic performance (Collins).
Researchers surveyed more than 2,800 students about their nutritional habits and examined their exam scores (Collins). After they organized differences in body mass index interpretations and physical activity levels, they learned that students who ate mostly fresh fruits and vegetables recorded an average of 7 percent higher in mathematics, writing, and reading related to their counterparts who ate a “Western” diet (Collins).
Teenage years are a sensitive period for the development of the brain. This time is also a time where nutrition is very important. Because this stage of life is so crucial I believe schools and all health departments should promote healthy eating. “To date, this is one of the few studies to report on the associations between dietary patterns and academic performance; therefore, more prospective studies are required to support our findings (Collins).”

Paleo Diet
The Paleo or Paleolithic diet is a popular diet that consist of eating whole fresh food, lean meats and healthy fats. The main concept behind the paleo diet is to adopt a diet that is similar to what supposedly the caveman and early humans had during the Paleolithic period. Early humans were known to be hunters and gatherers and as for that reason they ate a lot of fruits, vegetables, wild meat, fish, nuts, and eggs. Therefore, the paleo diet consist of only eating unprocessed meats, fish, lot of fruits and vegetables, and a moderate level of nuts and seeds. The paleo diet does not include any dairy products, grains, processed food, refined fat, or any food with added sugars. Contrary to popular beliefs this diet is not a low carb diet since it consist eating fruits and vegetables which contribute as a source of starch and sugar and instead this diet is more known to be high in protein. Some of the benefits that have been claimed from carrying out a Paleolithic diet include weight loss and lower cholesterol levels to name few, however, these have not been proven until recently. With the overwhelming increase in popularity researchers have begun to conduct scientific studies in order to determine whether or not the Paleolithic diet can truly improve an individual’s overall health. The University of Eastern Michigan recently conducted a study that put the Paleolithic diet to the test in order to see if participants between the ages of 40-62 who suffered from high cholesterol levels and weight problems could improve their health by strictly only carrying out the diet instead of getting on medication. The results showed that after 4 months of being on a Paleolithic nutrition or diet the participants saw a significant drop (P <  .001) in the mean of total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides and an increase in their HDL, which in return lowered their risk of developing heart disease, and there were signs of improvements with their weight as well. Although there are many other studies that have recently come out with results that seem to support that the diet does in fact work efficiently in helping people lose weight, lower cholesterol, and reduce risk of developing other chronic diseases, such as heart disease, there are still some nutrition experts that believe that the paleo diet may not work on everyone. Some dietician and nutritionist are even saying that excluding dairy products, beans, and healthy whole grains, such as the paleo diet has you do, may be a bad idea as these food items can bring a great amount of nutrients to a person’s diet and that when eaten in moderation can bring great benefits to a person’s overall health. The U.S News and World Report has also came out with a report that bashes the diet because after reviewing it Gretchen Spetz RD ,(registered dietician), found the diet be a very restrictive diet as you can only eat certain fresh food groups and certain types of meat and can also seem confusing to dieters. The paleo diet is and always will be a diet. There are and will always be people that are in favor of it and other that are against it. It important that it may not work for everyone bust has proven to be effective at times. As the paleo diet gains popularity expect to only see more information and studies on the matter.

Grapefruit Diet
[
]
The Grapefruit Diet has been around for over 80 years, beginning in the 1930s. It was introduced by Kelly D. Brownell, PhD. The Grapefruit Diet was designed to jumpstart a weight loss program so dieters could potentially lose large amounts of weight in a short duration of time. The diet is supposed to last for 10 to 12 days and has been highly popularized for being known as the diet where it is possible to lose 10 pounds in 10 days.  The diet claims that by eating half of a grapefruit before a meal high in fat and protein it will create a metabolic reaction making that individual a fat-burning machine (Freedman, 2001, p.7S). This thermogenic component in the grapefruit supposedly comes from a fat-burning enzyme within the fruit that acts as a catalyst and assists the body in burning high fat foods, resulting in weight loss. Grapefruits have no fat, they are low in calories and sodium, and are fully packed with vitamin C. The grapefruit diet is a low-carb diet that restricts one's total daily calorie intake to 800 calories per day. The diet severely restricts the consumption of carbohydrates, even the necessary carbohydrates such as: vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. The grapefruit diet highly encourages eating foods such as meat, eggs and any other foods that are rich in protein and fat.
Meal Plan
Breakfast:
•	2 boiled eggs
•	2 slices of bacon or meat
•	1/2 a grapefruit or 8 ounces of grapefruit juice
Lunch:
•	1/2 grapefruit or 8 ounces of grapefruit juice
•	Meat
•	Salad
Dinner:
•	1/2 grapefruit or 8 ounces of grapefruit juice
•	Salad with green or red vegetable cooked in butter or spices
•	Fish or meat
•	Coffee or tea
Research
There have been clinical research studies to evaluate the grapefruit's fat-burning enzyme potential. Early studies suggest people on this fad diet would lose weight, however this is probably due to the diet's restriction in calorie intake, rather than any fat burning properties in the grapefruit itself. However grapefruit contains the phytochemicals, naringenin and limonin, which have been confirmed to act as antioxidants in fighting against free radicals, and in reducing blood pressure and cholesterol (Chudnovskiy et al, 2014). However, this has been confirmed in rats so it cannot be certain that these two components also have the same effects on humans (Farouk, 2015). Although, latest research carried out b a group of scientist at the Nutrition and Medical Research Centre in San Diego, California have discovered that by adding grapefruit and grapefruit juice to one's diet can aid in weight loss.

Rapid Weight Loss Programs
As society continues to evolve, people around the world continue to have different ideas and opinions on what it truly means to be “skinny”. Individuals across the globe are constantly taking part in new rapid weight loss programs. Society is not completely satisfied with these weight loss dietary plans, including the gastric bypass surgery. Gastric bypass surgery is only for those who are considered obese. Many patients decide to take part in this surgery because of how rapid results can be. The numbers of these surgeries performed in the United States have been increasing greatly (Jimenez, 2003). The average age for this surgery is anywhere between 41 through 43, but there have been extreme cases such as 18 years old. The surgery is known to be very successful, but there have previous complications in the past.  In order to be considered for the surgery, one must have a BMI of over 35 and have severe health problems. The most common type of short-term complication is infection. The most common type of long-term infection is usually anastomotic stomal stenosis (Jimenez, 2003).
There have been several experiments were scientists test to see the consequences between rapid weight loss and gradual weight loss. It has been concluded that athletes who lose weight very rapidly are more likely to feel fatigue and weak. It was also stated that athletes who lose weight gradually would perform better than those who lose weight rapidly.
It is important to choose a healthy and efficient diet plan that will help you lose weight. Seeking professional help and care is essential to having a healthy diet plan.
Before heading to the doctors office one should be aware to:
-	Write any question you may have. (US department of health and human services)
-	Bring a family member for support. (US department of health and human services)
-	Bring a paper and pen. (US department of health and human services)
After a doctor has recommended a weight plan that fits best for you, you should conduct research on the program and see if it has any risks or concerns. You should also ask yourself questions like, “What does the weight-loss program include?” It is important that you choose a weight loss program that is realistic and will benefit you in the long run. Money can also be a serious problem for many individuals. If a weight loss program is not in your budget, you should look around until you find one that you can afford. Choosing rapid weight loss programs can sometimes have a negative effect on your body. With that being said, one should choose a program that is healthy, well balanced, and reasonable.

Nutrition as a Profession
TOC
Although the terms nutritionist and dietician are commonly used interchangeably, there is a distinction between the two on a professional level. A dietician is a nutritionist who completes the requirements set by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. A nutritionist who wants to become a dietitian must complete a program approved by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) and pass an exam to be considered a Registered Dietician (“ExploreHealthCareers,” n.d.). Put simply, a dietician is a nutritionist registered and certified by the CDR. The median salary for a dietician in the United States is $55,920, with the top 10% of dieticians earning $78,720 and the bottom 10% earning $33,980(“ How much do Nutritionists make?” n.d.). In addition, California is the state that pays its dieticians and nutritionists the most.
To begin a career in nutrition, a four-year bachelor’s degree is required. This degree is usually in a program that focuses on dietetics, nutrition, biology, or another type of physical science. To receive the Registered Dietician certification, an internship or work-study program with at least 1200 hours of supervised training must be completed (“Nutrition Careers,” n.d.). In some states, registered dieticians may be required to receive more credentialing in order to practice in that state, such as a Certified Dietician Nutritionist (“ExploreHealthCareers,” n.d.). Nevertheless, these additional licenses do not have more requirements beyond what is needed to become a registered dietician.
The field of nutrition can be divided in to three main settings in which dieticians and nutritionists can work. Registered dieticians and nutritionists can work in clinics, in the community, and in management (“ExploreHealthCareers,” n.d.). In clinics, dieticians and nutritionists work individually with patients and their families. They evaluate, plan, and enact dietary strategies and nutritional therapies that are concentrated on improving various medical problems such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, dieticians and nutritionists in this setting, come up with plans to help patients that are receiving medical treatments that may impact their diets and appetite, like cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In the community, dieticians and nutritionists work in health and recreational centers. They work with and target specific populations such as the elderly or children. The goal of this targeting is to inform the public and enact new plans to achieve healthier lifestyles. Lastly, dieticians and nutritionists can work in management. They may work in various large-scale food-service operations that feed the community.

Professions in nutrition are on the rise in the United States and hospitals are not the only place looking to hire nutritionists (nutritioned.org, 2015). Nutritionists and dietitians are finding jobs in health care, education, food service, daycare programs, corporate cafeterias, and even fast food chains (eatrightpro.org, 2015). Even Firs Lady Michelle Obama has made the importance of food literacy a major priority on a national level (Publichealth.org, 2015).
Nutritionists and dietitians are not the same thing contrary to a lot of people’s knowledge. Basically a dietitian is a nutritionist who is licensed and registered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR). (Publichealth.org, 2015) To become a registered dietitian you need to complete a 4-year bachelor’s degree program in a nutrition or physical science related field and 1200 hours of supervised training through an approved internship or work-study program. There are over 250 ACEND (Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics) –accredited dietetic internship programs in the United States. Registered dietitian nutritionists are nutrition and food experts who can bridge the gap of the science of nutrition and healthy living to help individuals make distinctive and positive lifestyle changes.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States of Labor states the mean annual salary for a registered dietician nationally was averaged at $56,170 in 2012. The animal food manufacturing industry was the top paying industry where dieticians worked and they made an average of $88,100 a year (Publichealth.org, 2015).
Dietitians do a variety of different things in their everyday work. They provide food and nutrition plans and programs to people, patients, athletes, etc. They help their patients with weight loss and other diet related interests (academics.aces.illinois.edu , 2015). Most importantly dietitians provide and promote healthy eating habits and dietary modifications to help prevent and treat illnesses.

In today’s society, there are many career opportunities available in nutritional
sciences. Colleges and universities now have the option for students to major
and/or minor in nutrition as well. The role of nutrition is increasing in importance
largely because a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of many
medical conditions that doctors diagnose on a daily basis. Dieticians implement
nutrition programs and oversee the preparation and serving of meals. Like any
other health care provider, their goal is to prevent and treat patients’ illnesses by
educating them about proper eating habits and making adjustments to their current
diet. Three types specialties for dietitians that will be discussed in this section are
clinical dietitian, community dietitian, and consultant. Clinical dietitians offer
nutritional services to patients in nursing homes, hospitals, and other institutions.
Their job is to create a nutritional program based on the patient’s nutritional needs,
evaluate, and provide feedback of the patient’s personalized program. They discuss
the medical and nutritional needs with the patient’s doctors and other health care
providers (“Careers in Food,” n.d.). Clinical dietitians can also specialize in fields
such as pediatric, renal, diabetes, nutrition support, and many more. Usually the
clinical dietitian is required to be a registered dietitian nutritionist, otherwise
known as an RDN (“Career Opportunities,” n.d.). In addition to clinical dietitians,
other types of dieticians exist in nutrition. Community dieticians counsel people on
nutritional practices that are made to promote health and prevent illnesses. They
work in public health clinics, health maintenance organizations, and home health
agencies. At these places, community dietitians are able to assess individuals’ needs,
design plans based off these needs, and teach them about how to follow the plan
accordingly. A consultant dietitian can own a private practice or work at a health
care facility. They can administer nutrition screenings and advise their clients about
health concerns that are impacted by diet such as weight loss. This specialty is very
versatile in that a consultant can work for sports teams and even wellness programs
(“Careers in Food,” n.d.).
With a focus in health and human nutrition, people can become a public health
educator. State and local departments of public health employ them, and their job is
to direct State-mandated public health programs. Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) is an organization that a public health educator could potentially work closely
with or for. WIC serves low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding
postpartum women and children under the age of five who are at nutritional risk.
They provide supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for
these people (“Women, Infants, and Children,” n.d.). Other job opportunities in this
field of nutrition are cooperative extension offices and the Congregate Meals
program (“Career Opportunities,” n.d.).
