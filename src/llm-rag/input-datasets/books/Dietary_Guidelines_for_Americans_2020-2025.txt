The Guidelines
Make every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans�
Here’s how:
1
Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage�
At every life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and
older adulthood—it is never too early or too late to eat healthfully.
• For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human milk. Continue to feed infants
human milk through at least the first year of life, and longer if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant
formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable. Provide infants with supplemental
vitamin D beginning soon after birth.
• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense complementary foods. Introduce infants to
potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods. Encourage infants and toddlers
to consume a variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich in iron and zinc, particularly for
infants fed human milk.
• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet
nutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.
2
Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect
personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations�
A healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, or current health
status. The Dietary Guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and
preferences, as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the United States.
3
Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages,
and stay within calorie limits�
An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from
foods and beverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide
vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across
all food groups, in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.
The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:
• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and
other vegetables
• Fruits, especially whole fruit
• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain
• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified
soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives
• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts,
seeds, and soy products
• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts
Page ix | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary
4 Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and
limit alcoholic beverages�
At every life stage, meeting food group recommendations—even with nutrient-dense choices—requires most
of a person’s daily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy dietary pattern doesn’t have much room for
extra added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic beverages. A small amount of added sugars,
saturated fat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and beverages to help meet food group
recommendations, but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited. Limits are:
• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with
added sugars for those younger than age 2.
• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2.
• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and even less for children younger than age 14.
• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink, or to drink in moderation by
limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is
consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink
alcohol, such as women who are pregnant.

Setting the Stage
The foods and beverages that people consume have a profound
impact on their health. The scientific connection between food
and health has been well documented for many decades, with
substantial evidence showing that healthy dietary patterns can help
people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of
chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan. Yet, Federal
data show that from the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans in 1980 through today, Americans have fallen far short
of meeting its recommendations, and diet-related chronic disease
rates have risen to pervasive levels and continue to be a major public
health concern.
The Dietary Guidelines is an important part of a complex,
multifaceted approach to promote health and reduce
chronic disease risk. The Dietary Guidelines provides
science-based advice on what to eat and drink to
promote health, help reduce risk of chronic disease,
and meet nutrient needs. The Dietary Guidelines is
the foundation of Federal food, nutrition, and health
policies and programs. An important audience is health
professionals and nutrition program administrators
who work with the general public to help them
consume a healthy and nutritionally adequate diet and
establish policies and services to support these efforts.
Comprehensive, coordinated strategies built on the
science-based foundation of the Dietary Guidelines—and
a commitment to drive these strategies over time across
sectors and settings—can help all Americans consume
healthy dietary patterns, achieve and maintain good
health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
Grounded in Science and Focused on
Public Health
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of
Health and Human Services (HHS) update the Dietary
Guidelines at least every 5 years, based on the current
science. A fundamental premise of the Dietary Guidelines
is that everyone, no matter their age, race, or ethnicity,
economic circumstances, or health status, can benefit
from shifting food and beverage choices to better
support healthy dietary patterns.

A Spotlight on Dietary Patterns
Although many of its recommendations have remained
relatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines
has evolved as scientific knowledge has grown. Early
Dietary Guidelines editions used evidence that examined
the relationships between individual nutrients, foods,
and food groups and health outcomes. In recent years,
researchers, public health experts, and registered
dietitians have acknowledged that nutrients and
foods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people
consume them in various combinations over time—a
dietary pattern—and these foods and beverages act
synergistically to affect health.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines put this understanding
into action by focusing its recommendations on
consuming a healthy dietary pattern. The 2020-2025
Dietary Guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the
importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole—
rather than on individual nutrients or foods in isolation.
Serving as a framework, the Guidelines’ dietary patterns
approach enables policymakers, programs, and health
professionals to help people personalize their food
and beverage choices to accommodate their wants
and needs, food preferences, cultural traditions and
customs, and budgetary considerations.
Healthy Dietary Patterns at Every
Life Stage
The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines takes the dietary
patterns approach one step further by focusing on
the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns
at every stage of life, from birth to older adulthood.
It provides recommendations for healthy dietary
patterns by life stage, identifying needs specific to
each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern
characteristics that should be carried forward into the
next stage of life. And, for the first time since the 1985
edition, this edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes
recommendations for infants and toddlers as well as
continuing the emphasis on healthy dietary patterns
during pregnancy and lactation.
This approach recognizes that each life stage is
distinct—nutrient needs vary over the lifespan and
each life stage has unique implications for food and
beverage choices and disease risk. At the same time, it
recognizes an important continuity. Because early food
preferences influence later food choices, establishing a
healthy dietary pattern early in life may have a beneficial
impact on health promotion and disease prevention
over the course of decades.

participants with obesity, as well as studies
that enrolled some participants with a disease.
Because the Dietary Guidelines is not intended to
be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases,
the Committee excluded studies that enrolled only
patients with a disease with the intention to treat
those individuals.
In general, the majority of the reviews conducted
to inform the Dietary Guidelines included trials that
exclusively enrolled participants with overweight or
obesity, or who were at high risk of cardiovascular
disease or type 2 diabetes, and observational
studies that enrolled participants from a wide
range of health and weight status, including those
with healthy weight, overweight, or obesity. The
reviews included few studies that enrolled only
healthy participants.
Thus, the Dietary Guidelines are applicable to
the overall U.S. population, including healthy
individuals and people at risk of diet-related
chronic conditions and diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and
obesity. In addition, people living with a diet-
related chronic illness can benefit from a healthy
dietary pattern. The Dietary Guidelines can serve
as a reference for Federal, medical, voluntary,
and patient care organizations as they develop
nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a

can adapt the Dietary Guidelines to meet the
specific needs of their patients with chronic
diseases, as part of a multifaceted treatment plan.

an opportunity for the public to provide oral comments
to the Committee. An ongoing period for written public
comments to the Committee spanned 15 months of
its work. And, for the first time, a final public meeting
was included for the Committee to discuss its draft
scientific report 1 month before the final report was
posted for public comment.
In addition to documenting its rigorous review of the
evidence to answer the scientific questions from USDA
and HHS and providing advice for the Departments’
development of the next Dietary Guidelines edition,
the Committee provided recommendations for future
research. These research recommendations reflected
an acknowledgment that science in nutrition, diet, and
health associations continues to evolve, and that new
findings build on and enhance existing evidence.
Upon submitting its final scientific report to the USDA
and HHS Secretaries, the Committee disbanded. The
Departments then posted the scientific report and
asked the public for comments. The Departments
received written comments on the report over a
30-day period and also held an online meeting to
hear oral comments.

Implementation of the Dietary Guidelines Through MyPlate
Using MyPlate as a Guide To Support Healthy
Dietary Patterns
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is developed and written for a professional audience. Therefore, its
translation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help individuals, families, and
communities achieve healthy dietary patterns.
MyPlate is one example of consumer translation. Created to be used in various settings and adaptable
to meeting personal preferences, cultural foodways, traditions, and budget needs, MyPlate is used by
professionals across sectors to help people become more aware of and informed about making healthy food
and beverage choices over time. More information is available at MyPlate.gov.
Following a healthy dietary pattern from birth through older adulthood can have a profound impact on a person’s
lifelong health. The Dietary Guidelines provides the framework for following such a pattern. However, broad and
multisector collaboration is needed to help people achieve that goal. Action on many fronts is needed to ensure
that healthy dietary choices at home, school, work, and play are the affordable, accessible norm. Everyone has a
role to play in helping all Americans shift to a healthy dietary pattern and achieve better health.
Try the MyPlate Plan
A healthy eating routine is important at every stage of life and can have positive effects that add up
over time. It’s important to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy or fortified soy alternatives,
and protein foods. When deciding what to eat or drink, choose options that are full of nutrients.
Make every bite count.
Think about how the following recommendations can come together over the course of your day or
week to help you create a healthy eating routine:

Key Dietary Principles
To help people meet the Guidelines and Key Recommendations, the
following are important principles when making decisions about nutrient-
dense food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern.
MEET NUTRITIONAL NEEDS PRIMARILY FROM FOODS
AND BEVERAGES
The Dietary Guidelines are designed to meet the Recommended Dietary
Allowances and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as
Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges, all set by the National
Academies. An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that
nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beverages—
specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. In some cases, when
meeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible, fortified foods and
nutrient-containing dietary supplements are useful. It is important to note
that the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink
often is determined ultimately by how a food item, dish, or meal is prepared,
at home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer. Based on
the U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of healthy dietary
patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices
one decision, one meal, one day at a time—and consistently over time.
CHOOSE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FROM EACH FOOD GROUP
Enjoy different foods and beverages within each food group. This can
help meet nutrient needs—and also allows for flexibility so that the Dietary
Guidelines can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences.
All forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, frozen, and 100% juices,
in nutrient-dense forms, can be included in healthy dietary patterns.
PAY ATTENTION TO PORTION SIZE
Portion size is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or
beverage served or consumed in one eating occasion. It is important to
pay attention to portion size when making food and beverage choices,
particularly for foods and beverages that are not nutrient-dense. A concept
that can help people choose appropriate portions is serving size. This term
is included on the Nutrition Facts label and refers to the amount of a food
or beverage that is customarily consumed—it is not a recommendation
of how much to eat or drink. Consuming less than the stated serving
size results in consuming fewer calories and other nutrients or food
components. Some products may have multiple servings per package.
Page 25 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan
Most Americans Do Not Follow a Healthy Dietary Pattern
The typical dietary patterns currently consumed by many in the United States do not align with the Dietary
Guidelines (Figure 1-4). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure of diet quality that can be used to assess
compliance with the Dietary Guidelines. For Americans ages 2 and older, HEI-2015 scores indicate that intakes are
not consistent with recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern. Average diet quality has slightly improved in
the past 10 years, but the average score of 59 (on a scale from 0 to 100) indicates that people have much room for
improvement. Differences in overall HEI scores are seen across age, sex, race-ethnic, and income subgroups and
by pregnancy and lactation status, though poor diet quality is observed across all groups. With each step closer to
a diet that aligns with the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern, HEI scores will increase and risk for chronic
disease will decrease.

In addition, the high percentage of the population with overweight or obesity suggests that many people in the United
States consume foods and beverages that contribute to a calorie imbalance, a situation more likely to occur with low
physical activity. As shown in the Introduction, Table I-1, 74 percent of all adults and 40 percent of all children and
youth in the United States have either overweight or obesity.
Even from the youngest ages, almost all Americans should shift to healthier food and beverage choices and
consume smaller portions to achieve a healthy dietary pattern within an appropriate number of calories. It is never
too early or too late to improve intake and establish a healthy dietary pattern.

Focus on Meeting Food Group Needs With
Nutrient-Dense Foods and Beverages,
and Stay Within Calorie Limits
The Dietary Guidelines include recommendations for food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, and protein foods—
eaten at an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
Science shows that these same core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are consistent across each life stage.
However, as shown in Figure 1-6, when compared to the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, most Americans have
substantial room for improvement:
• More than 80 percent have dietary patterns that are low in vegetables, fruits, and dairy.
• More than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations,
but are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.

Fruits 3
The fruit food group includes whole fruits and 100% fruit
juice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and
dried forms. Whole fruits can be eaten in various forms,
such as cut, sliced, diced, or cubed. At least half of the
recommended amount of fruit should come from whole
fruit, rather than 100% juice. When juices are consumed,
they should be 100% juice and always pasteurized or
100% juice diluted with water (without added sugars).
Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options
that are canned with 100% juice or options lowest in
added sugars.
About 80 percent of the U.S. population does not meet
fruit recommendations. Over 60 percent of all fruit
intake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen,

Follow Food Safety Recommendations
An important part of healthy eating is keeping food safe. Individuals in their own homes can help keep
food safe by following safe food handling practices. Four basic food safety principles work together to
reduce the risk of foodborne illness—Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.
1: Clean 2: Separate 3: Cook 4: Chill
Wash hands and Separate raw meats Cook food to safe Refrigerate foods
surfaces often. from other foods. internal temperatures. promptly.
Some eating behaviors, such as consuming raw, undercooked, or unpasteurized food products, increase the risk of
contracting a foodborne illness. Populations at increased risk of foodborne illness, or those preparing food for them,
should use extra caution. These include women who are pregnant, young children, and older adults. Specific guidance
for these life stages is discussed in subsequent chapters. Individuals with weakened immune systems are also at
increased risk for foodborne illness. More information about food safety is available at:

Oils
Oils are important to consider as part of a healthy dietary pattern as they provide essential fatty acids. Commonly
consumed oils include canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. Oils also are naturally
present in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados. The fat in some tropical plants, such as coconut oil, palm
kernel oil, and palm oil, are not included in the oils category because they contain a higher percentage of saturated
fat than do other oils.
Strategies to shift intake include cooking with vegetable oil in place of fats high in saturated fat, including butter,
shortening, lard, or coconut oil. However, some foods, such as desserts and sweet snacks, that are prepared with
oils instead of fats high in saturated fat are still high in added sugars, and are thus not a nutrient-dense food choice.
Beverages
When choosing beverages in a healthy dietary pattern, both the calories and nutrients that they provide are important
considerations. Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as
fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Coffee, tea, and flavored
waters also are options, but the most nutrient-dense options for these beverages include little, if any, sweeteners or
cream. For discussion on sugar-sweetened beverages or alcohol, see “Added Sugars” and “Alcoholic Beverages,”
respectively.
CAFFEINE
Caffeine is a dietary component that functions in the body as a stimulant. Most intake of caffeine in the United
States comes from coffee, tea, and soda. Caffeine is a substance that is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in
cola-type beverages by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For healthy adults, the FDA has cited 400 milligrams
per day of caffeine as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects. Additional information
related to caffeine is provided in subsequent life stage chapters.

Beverages and Added Sugars 3
Examples of beverages that often have added
sugars are regular soda (i.e., not sugar-free), fruit
drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened
waters, and coffee and tea beverages with added
sugars. Coffee and tea beverages from restaurants
can contain many extra calories because of the
addition of cream or milk and sugar. See below

If a healthy dietary pattern is consumed, amounts
of calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber can meet
recommendations. Individuals should be encouraged
to make shifts to increase the intake of vegetables,
fruits, beans, whole grains, and dairy to move intakes
of these underconsumed dietary components closer to
recommendations. In some cases, fortified foods and
dietary supplements may be useful in providing one
or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed
in less than recommended amounts. Vitamin D
recommendations are harder to achieve through
natural sources from diet alone and would require
consuming foods and beverages fortified with vitamin

Limit Foods and Beverages Higher in
Added Sugars, Saturated Fat, and Sodium,
and Limit Alcoholic Beverages
A healthy dietary pattern is designed to meet food group and nutrient recommendations while staying within
calorie needs. Additionally, a healthy dietary pattern is designed to not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level
(UL) or Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for nutrients. To achieve these goals, the pattern is based on
consuming foods and beverages in their nutrient-dense forms—forms with the least amounts of added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium.
Most of the calories a person needs to eat each day—around 85 percent—are needed to meet food group
recommendations healthfully, in nutrient-dense forms. The remaining calories—around 15 percent—are calories
available for other uses, including for added sugars or saturated fat beyond the small amounts found in nutrient-
dense forms of foods and beverages within the pattern, to consume more than the recommended amount of a food
group, or for alcoholic beverages. This equates to 250 to 350 remaining calories for calorie patterns appropriate for
most Americans.

Making Healthy Choices: One Day At a Time
Small changes to more nutrient-dense, single food and beverage choices that, when combined, become a nutrient-
dense meal, can lead to a whole day made up of nutrient-dense meals and snacks. The following example, which

The nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink often is determined
ultimately by how a food item, dish or meal is prepared, at home and away from home, or
produced by a manufacturer. Based on the U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of
healthy dietary patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices one

Sodium
Sodium is an essential nutrient primarily consumed as
salt (sodium chloride). Healthy eating patterns
limit sodium to the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction
(CDRR) levels defined by the National Academies—
1,200 mg/day for ages 1 through 3; 1,500 mg/day for
ages 4 through 8; 1,800 mg/day for ages 9 through 13;
and 2,300 mg/day for all other age groups. The CDRR for
sodium was established using evidence of the benefit of
reducing sodium intake on cardiovascular risk and
hypertension risk.
As a food ingredient, sodium is used in multiple ways,
including curing meat, baking, as a thickening agent, as a
flavor enhancer, as a preservative, and to retain moisture.
The nutrient-dense choices in the Healthy U.S.-Style
Dietary Pattern provide approximately 60-100 percent of
the age-specific CDRR for sodium across calorie levels
with amounts ranging from about 1,000 to 2,200 mg.
For most calorie levels and at most ages, there is very
little room for food choices that are high in sodium.
Average intakes of sodium are high across the U.S.
population compared to the CDRRs. Average intakes
for those ages 1 and older is 3,393 milligrams per day,
with a range of about 2,000 to 5,000 mg per day. Only a
small proportion of total sodium intake is from sodium
inherent in foods or from salt added in home cooking
or at the table. Most sodium consumed in the United
States comes from salt added during commercial food
processing and preparation, including foods prepared
at restaurants.
Sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories
across the food supply (Figure 1-12), including mixed
dishes such as sandwiches, burgers, and tacos; rice,
pasta, and grain dishes; pizza; meat, poultry, and
seafood dishes; and soups. Calorie intake is highly
associated with sodium intake (i.e., the more foods and
beverages people consume, the more sodium they tend
to consume).
Because sodium is found in so many foods, multiple
strategies should be implemented to reduce sodium
intake to the recommended limits. Careful choices are
needed in all food groups to reduce intake. Strategies
to lower sodium intake include cooking at home more
often; using the Nutrition Facts label to choose products
with less sodium, reduced sodium, or no-salt-added, etc.;
and flavoring foods with herbs and spices instead of salt
based on personal and cultural foodways.

Human milk feeding alone is the ideal form of nutrition
from birth through about age 6 months. Human milk
provides necessary nutrients, protective factors against
disease, and other unique immunological benefits. If
human milk is unavailable, infants should be fed an iron-
fortified commercial infant formula. Once an infant is
developmentally ready, foods and beverages should be
introduced to complement human milk feeding. These
complementary foods and beverages are essential to
meet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at
about age 6 months and should be selected carefully
to help meet these needs. As an infant becomes a

textures, the goal of complementary feeding becomes

Donor Human Milk
If families do not have sufficient human milk for their infant but want to feed their infant human
milk, they may look for alternative ways to obtain it. It is important for the family to obtain
pasteurized donor human milk from a source, such as an accredited human milk bank, that has
screened its donors and taken appropriate safety precautions. When human milk is obtained
directly from individuals or through the internet, the donor is unlikely to have been screened for
infectious diseases, and it is unknown whether the human milk has been collected or stored in
a way to reduce possible safety risks to the baby. More information is available at fda.gov/science-research/
pediatrics/use-donor-human-milk.

Proper Handling and Storage of Human Milk and
Infant Formula
• Wash hands thoroughly before expressing human milk or preparing to feed
human milk or infant formula.
• If expressing human milk, ensure pump parts are thoroughly cleaned
before use.
• If preparing powdered infant formula, use a safe water source and follow
instructions on the label.
• Refrigerate freshly expressed human milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days.
Previously frozen and thawed human milk should be used within 24 hours.
Thawed human milk should never be refrozen. Refrigerate prepared infant
formula for up to 24 hours.
• Do not use a microwave to warm human milk or infant formula. Warm safely
by placing the sealed container of human milk or infant formula in a bowl of
warm water or under warm, running tap water.
• Once it has been offered to the infant, use or discard leftovers quickly (within
2 hours for human milk or 1 hour for infant formula).
• Thoroughly wash all infant feeding items, such as bottles and nipples.
Consider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age,
infants born prematurely, or infants with a compromised immune system.

necessary.
Foods at About 6 Months Old
At about age 6 months, infants should be introduced to nutrient-dense,
developmentally appropriate foods to complement human milk or
infant formula feedings. Some infants may show developmental signs
of readiness before age 6 months (see “Developmental Readiness for
Beginning to Eat Solid Foods”), but introducing complementary foods
before age 4 months is not recommended. Waiting until after age 6
months to introduce foods also is not recommended. Starting around
that time, complementary foods are necessary to ensure adequate
nutrition and exposure to flavors, textures, and different types of foods.
Infants should be given age- and developmentally appropriate foods to
help prevent choking. It is important to introduce potentially allergenic
foods along with other complementary foods. For infants fed human
milk, it is particularly important to include complementary foods that
are rich in iron and zinc when starting complementary foods (see
Appendix 1: Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups).
About one-third (32%) of infants in the United States are introduced
to complementary foods and beverages before age 4 months,
highlighting the importance of providing guidance and support to
parents, guardians, and caregivers on the timing of introduction to
complementary foods. Early introduction of complementary foods and
beverages is higher among infants receiving infant formula (42%) or
a combination of infant formula and human milk (32%) than among
infants exclusively fed human milk (19%).
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 56
BIRTH THROUGH 23 MONTHS
Developmental Readiness for Beginning To
Eat Solid Foods
The age at which infants reach different developmental
stages will vary. Typically between age 4 and 6 months,
infants develop the gross motor, oral, and fine motor skills
necessary to begin to eat complementary foods. As an
infant’s oral skills develop, the thickness and texture of
foods can gradually be varied. Signs that an infant is ready
for complementary foods include:
• Being able to control head and neck.
• Sitting up alone or with support.
• Bringing objects to the mouth.
• Trying to grasp small objects, such as toys or food.
• Swallowing food rather than pushing it back out
onto the chin.
Infants and young children should be given age- and
developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent
choking. Foods such as hot dogs, candy, nuts and
seeds, raw carrots, grapes, popcorn, and chunks of
peanut butter are some of the foods that can be a choking
risk for young children. Parents, guardians, and caregivers
are encouraged to take steps to decrease choking
risks, including:
• Offering foods in the appropriate size, consistency, and
shape that will allow an infant or young child to eat and
swallow easily.
• Making sure the infant or young child is sitting up
in a high chair or other safe, supervised place.
• Ensuring an adult is supervising feeding
during mealtimes.
• Not putting infant cereal or other solid foods in an
infant’s bottle. This could increase the risk of choking
and will not make the infant sleep longer.
More information on foods that can present choking
hazards is available from USDA at wicworks.fns.

Introduce Infants to Potentially Allergenic Foods
Along With Other Complementary Foods
Potentially allergenic foods (e.g., peanuts, egg, cow milk products,
tree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, fish, and soy) should be
introduced when other complementary foods are introduced to an
infant’s diet. Introducing peanut-containing foods in the first year
reduces the risk that an infant will develop a food allergy to peanuts.

but good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain
adequate iron status and prevent deficiency.
INTRODUCE ZINC-RICH FOODS TO INFANTS
STARTING AT ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD
Zinc-rich complementary foods (e.g., meats, beans, zinc-
fortified infant cereals) are important from age 6 months
onwards to support adequate zinc status, which supports
growth and immune function. Although the zinc content
of human milk is initially high and efficiently absorbed, the
concentration declines over the first 6 months of lactation
and is not affected by maternal zinc intake. During the
second half of infancy, approximately half (54%) of U.S.
infants fed human milk have inadequate zinc intake.
Prioritizing zinc-rich foods starting at 6 months of age to
complement human milk feedings will help infants meet
their requirement for zinc.

BIRTH THROUGH 23 MONTHS
DIETARY COMPONENTS TO LIMIT
While encouraging intake from each food group, some dietary
components should be limited.
Avoid Added Sugars
Infants and young children have virtually no room in their diet for
added sugars. This is because the nutrient requirements for infants
and young children are quite high relative to their size, but the amount
of complementary foods they consume is small. Complementary
foods need to be nutrient-dense and not contain additional calories
from added sugars. In addition, low- and no-calorie sweeteners, which
can also be called high-intensity sweeteners, are not recommended
for children younger than age 2. Taste preferences are being formed
during this time period, and infants and young children may develop
preferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods
during this timeframe. For more information on added sugars,
see Chapter 1.
Avoid Foods Higher in Sodium
Sodium is found in a number of foods, including some salty snacks,
commercial toddler foods, and processed meats. In addition to
keeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers (see Appendix 1),
another reason to avoid high-sodium foods is that taste preferences
for salty food may be established early in life. Choose fresh or
low-sodium frozen foods, when available, and low-sodium canned
foods to minimize sodium content. For more information on sodium,
see Chapter 1.
Avoid Honey and Unpasteurized Foods and Beverages
Infants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked
honey. Honey can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that
could cause serious illness or death among infants. Infants and
young children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or
beverages, such as unpasteurized juices, milk, yogurt, or cheeses, as
they could contain harmful bacteria.
Establish a Healthy Beverage Pattern
An important part of establishing an overall healthy dietary pattern is
careful consideration of beverages. Guidance for different beverage
categories is provided below.
WATER
For healthy infants with adequate intake of human milk or infant
formula, supplemental water is typically not needed in the first
6 months. Small amounts (up to 4 to 8 ounces per day) of plain,
fluoridated drinking water can be given to infants with the introduction
of complementary foods. Plain, fluoridated drinking water intake
can slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and
fluoride needs.
Page 61 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers
BIRTH THROUGH 23 MONTHS
COW MILK AND FORTIFIED SOY BEVERAGES
Infants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy
beverages before age 12 months to replace human milk
or infant formula. Cow milk does not have the correct
amount of nutrients for infants, and its higher protein
and mineral content are hard for an infant’s kidneys
and digestive system to process. Plain cow milk (whole
milk) or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be
offered beginning around 12 months of age to help
meet calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein needs.
Flavored milks for children age 12 through 23 months
should be avoided because they contain added sugars.
PLANT-BASED MILK ALTERNATIVES
Plant-based milk alternatives, which are sometimes
referred to as milk alternatives, include beverages made
from plants, such as soy, oat, rice, coconut, and almond.
These beverages should not be used in the first year of
life to replace human milk or infant formula. They may
come in different flavors and some forms have added
sugars. Unsweetened versions of these beverages may
be accommodated in small amounts in the diet during
the second year of life, but most have significantly

Approximately 60 percent of toddlers meet or exceed
recommended intakes for fruit. A majority of fruit
is consumed as whole fruit (fresh, canned, puréed,
frozen) or as 100% fruit juice. Average intake of total
vegetables is below the range of recommended
amounts, with nearly 90 percent of toddlers falling short
Vegetables of recommendations. About one-half of vegetables are
consumed on their own, one-quarter are consumed as
part of a mixed dish, and nearly 5 percent are consumed
as savory snacks (e.g., potato chips).
Total grains, particularly refined grains, are consumed
in amounts that exceed recommendations. Conversely,
intakes of whole grains fall short of recommended
amounts for more than 95 percent of toddlers. A
majority of grains are consumed through breads, rolls,
tortillas, or other bread products or as part of a mixed
dish. Ten percent of grains come from sweet bakery
products and approximately 15 percent come from
crackers and savory snacks. Many of these categories
are top sources of sodium or added sugars in this
age group.
Grains
Average intakes of dairy foods, most of which is
consumed as milk, generally exceed recommended
amounts in this age group. Intakes of yogurt and cheese
account for about 10 percent of dairy intakes. Plant-
based beverages and flavored milks each make up
about 2 percent of dairy intakes among toddlers.
Protein foods intakes fall within recommended range,
on average. Intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs make
up a majority of protein foods intakes, however seafood

group can reduce sodium intake by eating less cured or
processed meats including hot dogs, deli meats,

Due to the relatively high nutrient needs of toddlers, a
healthy dietary pattern has virtually no room for added
sugars. Toddlers consume an average of more than 100
calories from added sugars each day, ranging from 40 to
250 calories a day (about 2.5 to 16 teaspoons). Sugar-
sweetened beverages, particularly fruit drinks, contribute

Vegetarian Dietary Pattern During the Second Year of Life
A Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern for young children ages 12 through 23 months who
are not fed human milk or infant formula is included in Appendix 3. This pattern describes
a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet that includes regular consumption of eggs, dairy products, soy
products, and nuts or seeds, in addition to vegetables including beans, peas, and lentils, fruits,
grains, and oils. Iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods contain only
non-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than is heme iron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme
iron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin B also may be of concern because it is present only in
12
animal source foods. When feeding infants and toddlers a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, parents, caregivers, and
guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron, vitamin
B , and/or other nutrients is necessary and if so, appropriate levels to meet their unique needs.
12
Supporting Healthy Eating
Parents, guardians, and caregivers play an important role in nutrition during this life stage because infants and
toddlers are fully reliant on them for their needs. In addition to “what” to feed children, “how” to feed young children
also is critical. As noted above, repeated exposure to foods can increase acceptance of new foods. Another
important concept is responsive feeding, a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger
or fullness cues of an infant or young child (see “Responsive Feeding”).

Accessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern
Many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during
infancy and toddlerhood. These include the following Government programs
that aim to support a healthy dietary pattern for infants and toddlers living in
households with limited incomes:
• The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) supports infant and early childhood nutrition through
supplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by
providing breastfeeding support and iron-fortified infant formula when
human milk is unavailable or fed only partially. WIC accommodates
the transition to solid foods by providing nutrient-dense foods in the
supplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers. Nutrition
education and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are
other important resources offered to income-eligible WIC participants.
• The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides reimbursement
for nutrient-dense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in
participating child care centers, including at Head Start programs, and day
care homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health
screenings and families can be connected to health services to support their
overall well-being.
• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest
food assistance program in the United States. SNAP helps meet the
nutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in low-income households by
providing temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy
dietary pattern.
These Government nutrition programs are especially important for the
14 percent3 of families with children who experience food insecurity and may
struggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern.
Professionals can use these, and additional Government and non-Government
resources that exist within communities, to support healthy eating during
infancy and toddlerhood.
Looking Toward Chapter 3:
Children and Adolescents
This chapter focused on nutrition issues important to infants and toddlers—
exclusive human milk feeding, if possible; introducing nutrient-dense
complementary foods at about age 6 months; and encouraging infants
and toddlers to sample and consume a variety of nutrient-dense foods and
beverages to meet their needs. As toddlers grow and their dietary patterns
become more integrated with the family’s food patterns, new issues arise.
These issues, and how to accommodate them within a lifelong healthy
dietary pattern, are discussed in the next chapter, which focuses on children
and adolescents.

Introduction
Children and adolescents include
individuals ages 2 through 18—
a life stage characterized by transitions
and the formation of dietary patterns.
Suboptimal current intake patterns among
children and adolescents and inadequate
physical activity contribute to overweight
and obesity in this life stage and risk of
chronic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease) later in life.
Changing this trajectory is crucial because
dietary patterns established during this life
stage tend to continue into adult years.
Healthy eating throughout this life stage involves the child or adolescent,
families and caregivers, and institutions and settings where food is provided
and consumed. Young children are fully reliant on others to provide their
meals and snacks. As children transition to school-age and through
adolescence, they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have
more autonomy in the foods that are selected. New influences on eating
behavior also emerge, such as peer pressure, which can create opportunities
or challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and
longevity. Adolescents acquire ever-greater independence in their food
choices as they mature, with more time spent on their own with peers
and more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings.
Other factors that influence eating behavior include social supports,
exposure to food marketing and promotion, and policies that determine
community design.
Youth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns
of growth, development, and physical activity. Current intake data of
young children show some components of a healthy dietary pattern that
continue from the infant and toddler life stages. Before these components
of a healthy dietary pattern are established, however, diet quality worsens
through childhood and into adolescence and intake patterns drift further
from recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines. Active community support
is needed to help youth meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrient-
dense foods and beverages.

AGES 2-18
Childhood Overweight and Obesity
In the United States, 41 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity, and the prevalence
is higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents as compared to non-Hispanic Asians
and Whites. Overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns. Youth with obesity are
more likely to have immediate health risks, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and impaired glucose
tolerance. They also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the
teenage years and into adulthood. Psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and social concerns (e.g., bullying,
stigma) also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity.
The causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected. Behaviors (e.g., eating habits, level of physical
activity, sedentary time) and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity.
Genetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity. However, many opportunities
exist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages. The goal
for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal
growth and development. This can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrient-dense food and beverage choices,
minimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern, and encouraging regular
physical activity.

Children Ages 2 Through 8
In early childhood (ages 2 through 4), females require about 1,000 to 1,400 calories per day and males require
about 1,000 to 1,600 calories per day. With the transition to school-age (ages 5 through 8), females require
about 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day and males require about 1,200 to 2,000 calories per day.
Physical Activity
Childhood and adolescence is a critical period for developing movement
skills, learning healthy habits, and establishing a firm foundation for lifelong
health and well-being. For youth, regular physical activity can improve bone
health, cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and cognition (including
academic achievement), and reduce the symptoms of depression.
Preschool-aged children should be active throughout the day to enhance
growth and development. Adults caring for children during this age
should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types (light,
moderate, or vigorous intensity) and aim for at least 3 hours per day.
School-aged children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderate-
to-vigorous activity daily to attain the most health benefits from physical
activity. Most activity can be aerobic, like walking, running, or anything that
makes their heart beat faster. They also need muscle-strengthening and
bone-strengthening activities that make their muscles and bones strong, like
climbing on playground equipment, playing basketball, and jumping rope.

Guidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way® resources have more
information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how to get
started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.
Nutrient-Dense Foods
and Beverages
Nutrient-dense foods and
beverages provide vitamins,
minerals, and other health-
promoting components and
have little added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium.
Vegetables, fruits, whole grains,
seafood, eggs, beans, peas,
and lentils, unsalted nuts and
seeds, fat-free and low-fat dairy
products, and lean meats and
poultry—when prepared with no
or little added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium—are nutrient-
dense foods.

Juice
Many juice products, such as fruit drinks, contain minimal juice content and are considered
sugar-sweetened beverages because they are primarily composed of water with added sugars.
The percent of juice in a beverage may be found on the package label, such as “contains 25%
juice” or “100% fruit juice.” The Nutrition Facts label identifies the amount of sugars in juice
products that are not naturally occurring (i.e., added sugars). Although 100% fruit juice without added sugars can
be part of a healthy dietary pattern, it is lower in dietary fiber than whole fruit. Dietary fiber is a dietary component
of public health concern. With the recognition that fruit should mostly be consumed in whole forms, the amount
of fruit juice in the USDA Food Patterns ranges from 4 fluid ounces at the lower calorie levels and no more than 10
fluid ounces at the highest calorie levels.
Dairy and Fortified Soy Alternatives
Throughout childhood and adolescence, the types of dairy foods
consumed and their contribution to a healthy dietary pattern change. Milk
consumption, particularly milk as a beverage, is lower and cheese intake,
typically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, or pasta, is
higher among adolescents when compared to younger children. These
differences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between
current and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout
youth. Nutrient-dense options within the dairy group are unsweetened
fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages
and yogurt, and low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products. Dairy and
fortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are
underconsumed during these life stages. These include three nutrients
of public health concern discussed in Chapter 1: potassium, calcium,
and vitamin D. The nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the
importance of adequate consumption. This is especially relevant for
calcium and vitamin D, given that adolescents have an increased need for
consumption to support the accrual of bone mass.
Adolescent Nutrition
The difference between recommended food group amounts and current
intakes is greater for adolescents ages 14 through 18 than for any other
age group across the lifespan. As a result, adolescents are at greater risk
of dietary inadequacy than are other age groups. For adolescent males
and females, low intakes of nutrient-dense foods and beverages within
the grains, dairy and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables food groups
lead to low intakes of phosphorus, magnesium, and choline. Adolescent
females also consume less meat, poultry, and eggs than do adolescent
males, and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other
protein subgroups, including beans, peas, and lentils, this results in the
underconsumption of total protein. In addition, adolescent females
have low dietary intakes of iron, folate, vitamin B , and vitamin B . The

potential for nutrient deficiencies existing alongside underconsumption of
nutrients of public health concern for all Americans creates a concerning
constellation of nutritional risks at a time of rapid growth and development
along with the onset of puberty, menarche, and hormonal changes.

When exposed to nutrient-dense foods and beverages
at an early age and supported in making healthy choices
across environments, a healthy dietary pattern can
be established and maintained as children transition
to the adolescence life stage. With this transition
comes increasing autonomy, increased influence of
peers, and decreased influence of parents, guardians,
and caregivers on food choice. As a result, foods and
beverages are more commonly consumed outside of
the home, often with a preference for convenience foods
that often are not nutrient-dense. Parents, guardians,
and caregivers can continue to support healthy eating
during this life stage by providing convenient access to
nutrient-dense foods; involving children and adolescents
in meal decisions, shopping, and cooking; and guiding
adolescents’ selection of food purchased and consumed
outside the home. In schools and community settings,
healthy eating can be encouraged by creating an
environment that makes healthy choices the norm.

are critical during this life stage.
More than one-half of adults are
living with one or more chronic
disease—diseases that are often
related to poor-quality diets and
physical inactivity. Improving dietary
patterns in adulthood can play a
beneficial role in promoting health
and preventing the onset or rate of
progression of chronic disease. For
adults with overweight or obesity,
making healthful changes to dietary
patterns and increasing physical
activity will improve health and
prevent additional weight gain and/
or promote weight loss (see “The
Importance of Physical Activity” and
“Overweight and Obesity”).

ADULTS AGES 19-59
The Importance of Physical Activity
Adults who are physically active are healthier, feel better, and are less
likely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive.
For adults, regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits
(e.g., boost mood, reduce stress, improve sleep) and long-term benefits
(e.g., improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, dementia, and many
types of cancer).
Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical
activity is better than none. To attain the most health benefits from
physical activity, adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-
intensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, each week.
Adults also need muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting weights or
doing push-ups, at least 2 days each week.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way® resources have
more information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how
to get started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.
Overweight and Obesity
In the United States, 74 percent of adults have overweight or obesity,
creating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health
conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain
types of cancer.
Losing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task. It
requires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods
and beverages and increase the amount expended through physical
activity. Weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using
short-term solutions. They require a commitment to long-term lifestyle
change and often need support from healthcare providers, family
members, and social networks. Intensive behavioral interventions that
use one or more strategies—like group sessions and changes in both
diet and physical activity—can be effective for individuals trying to lose
a significant amount of weight. In addressing obesity, professionals
should be mindful of health problems stemming from obesity-related
stigma and discrimination.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website provides
resources to support preventing weight gain (cdc.gov/healthyweight/
prevention/index.html) and losing weight (cdc.gov/healthyweight/
losing_weight/index.html).

Healthy Dietary
Patterns
Adults are encouraged to follow the
recommendations on the types of foods and
beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern
described in Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health
Across the Lifespan: The Guidelines and Key
Recommendations. The USDA Dietary Patterns
provide a framework of nutrient-dense foods and
beverages that can be adapted to accommodate
budget, culture, and personal preferences to help
adults follow a healthy dietary pattern and meet
the Guidelines and their Key Recommendations.
Table 4-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern at eight calorie levels that are appropriate
for most adults ages 19 through 59 years to
illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food
groups and other dietary components that make
up healthy dietary patterns. In general, calorie
needs are lower for females compared to males.
Calorie needs decline throughout adulthood due
to changes in metabolism that accompany aging.
Level of physical activity, body composition, and
the presence of chronic disease are additional
factors that affect calorie needs.
Females ages 19 through 30 require about
1,800 to 2,400 calories a day. Males in this age
group have higher calorie needs of about 2,400
to 3,000 a day. Calorie needs for adults ages 31
through 59 are generally lower; most females
require about 1,600 to 2,200 calories a day and
males require about 2,200 to 3,000 calories a
day. Additional information on these estimates is
provided in Table 4-1 (footnote a) and in Appendix
2. Estimated Calorie Needs. The USDA Dietary
Patterns are discussed in greater detail in Chapter
1 and Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns.
Nutrient-Dense Foods and Beverages
Nutrient-dense foods and beverages provide vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting
components and have little added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits,
whole grains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and lentils, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free and
low-fat dairy products, and lean meats and poultry—when prepared with no or little added
sugars, saturated fat, and sodium—are nutrient-dense foods.

b Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in
Appendix 3.
c All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat; and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches, saturated fat, or
sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within the overall
limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts
of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat, or
alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3 for
all calorie levels of the pattern.

Special
Considerations
The dietary considerations for the general U.S.
population, including adults, are described in Chapter 1.
The following sections of this chapter focus on several
special considerations to support a healthy dietary
pattern for adults that reflect adults’ current intake
patterns and the prevalence of overweight and obesity
and diet-related chronic disease that become more
apparent in this life stage. These considerations include
a focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary
fiber, calcium, and vitamin D and to decrease intakes
of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Special
considerations related to alcoholic beverages also
are discussed.
Dietary Fiber
Dietary patterns that do not meet recommended
intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
contribute to low intakes of dietary fiber. More than
90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not
meet recommended intakes for dietary fiber. This
aligns with intake patterns where fruits, vegetables,
and whole grains are underconsumed by more than
85 percent of adults. Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for
Age-Sex Groups provides dietary fiber goals for men
and women based on the Dietary Reference Intakes.
These recommendations are based on levels observed
to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Increasing
intakes of fruits, vegetables, and replacing refined these nutrients. Particular attention should be given

About 70 to 75 percent of adults exceed the 10-percent
limit on saturated fat as a result of selecting foods and
beverages across food groups that are not in nutrient-
dense forms. The top sources of saturated fat for
adults are sandwiches (e.g., deli sandwiches, burgers,
tacos, burritos, grilled cheese, hot dogs) and other
grain-based mixed dishes (e.g. spaghetti and meatballs,
casseroles, quesadillas) that typically contain
ingredients from several food groups that are not in
nutrient-dense forms, including grains, protein foods,
and dairy. Making changes to the type of ingredients as
well as amount and/or frequency of their consumption
will help adults lower saturated fat intake without a
need to eliminate these foods from the household diet.
Strategies include using lean meats and low-fat cheese
to prepare these foods or substituting beans in place
of meats as the protein source. Saturated fat also can
be reduced by substituting certain ingredients with
sources of unsaturated fat (e.g., using avocado, nuts,
or seeds in a dish instead of cheese). Cooking with oils
higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat
(e.g., canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and
sunflower) instead of butter also can reduce intakes
of saturated fat.
Sodium

Alcoholic Beverages
Alcoholic beverages are not a component of the USDA
Dietary Patterns and their calories are considered
discretionary. Regular consumption of alcoholic
beverages can make it challenging for adults to meet
food group and nutrient needs while not consuming
excess calories. The ingredients in certain mixed drinks,
including soda, mixers, and heavy cream, also can
contribute to intake of added sugars and saturated fat.
The majority of U.S. adults consume alcoholic
beverages. About 66 percent of adults ages 21 through
59 report alcoholic beverage consumption in the
past month, and of those, approximately half report
binge drinking, sometimes multiple times per month.
Among adults who choose to drink, average intakes
of calories from alcoholic beverages exceed the
remaining calorie limit that is available after food group
recommendations are met.
There are some adults who should not drink alcoholic
beverages at all, such as if they are pregnant or might
be pregnant; younger than age 21; or recovering from
an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control
the amount they drink. For those who choose to drink,
intakes should be limited to 1 drink or less in a day
for women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men, on When adults prepare meals themselves, they have more

Special
Considerations
The nutrition considerations for the general U.S.
population described in Chapter 1 apply to women who
are pregnant or lactating. For example, the nutrients of
public health concern—calcium, vitamin D, potassium,
and dietary fiber—apply to these life stages as well.
In addition, iron is a nutrient of public health concern
for women who are pregnant. These life stages also
have some special nutrient and dietary considerations
regarding folate, iodine, choline, seafood, alcoholic
beverages, and caffeinated beverages that are discussed
in the following sections of this chapter.
Meeting Nutrient Needs
As discussed in Chapter 1, nutritional needs should be
met primarily through foods and beverages. However,
this may be difficult for some women, especially
those who are pregnant. Most healthcare providers
recommend women who are pregnant or planning to
become pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and months of pregnancy. Dietary supplements may contain

More than half of women continue to use prenatal
supplements during lactation. Most prenatal
supplements are designed to meet the higher iron needs
of pregnancy. Depending on various factors—such as
when menstruation returns—prenatal supplements
may exceed the iron needs of women who are lactating.
Women should seek guidance from a healthcare
provider regarding the appropriate level of iron
supplementation during lactation based on their
unique needs.
Iodine
Iodine needs increase substantially during pregnancy and
lactation (see Appendix 1). Adequate iodine intake during
pregnancy is important for neurocognitive development
of the fetus. Although women of reproductive age
generally have adequate iodine intake, some women,

During Pregnancy and Lactation
Women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern
during these life stages may need to take special care
to ensure nutrient adequacy. Iron may be of particular
concern because plant source foods only contain
non-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme
iron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme
iron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin

Physical Activity During Pregnancy and Postpartum
PREGNANCY
Physical activity during pregnancy can benefit both the mother and the baby. Physical activity increases or
maintains cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes.
For many benefits, healthy women without contraindications should do a least 150 minutes of moderate-
intensity aerobic activity a week, as they are able. Women who habitually did vigorous-intensity activity or
a lot of aerobic or muscle-strengthening physical activity before pregnancy can continue to do so during
pregnancy. Women can consult their healthcare provider about whether or how to adjust their physical
activity during pregnancy.
POSTPARTUM
Physical activity following the birth of a child continues to benefit a woman’s overall health. Physical activity
during the postpartum period increases cardiorespiratory fitness, improves mood, and reduces the symptoms
of postpartum depression. Additionally, physical activity can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight and,
when combined with caloric restriction, helps promote weight loss.
Women should start slow and build back up to more activity over time. Women should aim for at least 150
minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Move
Your Way® communications campaign have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get

number of older adults start this life stage
with excess body weight. Preventing
additional weight gain and achieving a
healthy weight by following a healthy
dietary pattern and adopting an active
lifestyle can support healthy aging.
Selecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people
throughout this life stage, regardless of their race or ethnicity or their
current health status. It is never too late to make improvements. Older
adults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing
dietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with
age. Older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even
increased nutrient needs compared to younger adults. The overall nutrient
density of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group. Lower
calorie needs result from less physical activity, changes in metabolism,
and/or age-related loss in bone and muscle mass. Other factors may affect
nutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults, including chronic
disease and conditions, use of multiple medications, and changes in body
composition. The healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique
needs of older adults into account and are further supported by special
considerations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging.

a Calorie level ranges: Females: 1,600-2,200 calories; Males: 2,000-2,600 calories. Energy levels are calculated based on median height and body
weight for healthy body mass index (BMI) reference individuals. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The
reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds. Calorie needs vary based on many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare
Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, and physical
activity level.
b Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (e.g., cup or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in
Appendix 3.
c All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat and prepared with minimal added sugars; refined starches, saturated fat, or
sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within the overall
limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts
of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat,
and/or alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
*NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3 for
all calorie levels of the pattern.

Physical Activity and Older Adults
The benefits of regular physical activity occur throughout life and are essential for healthy
aging. It is never too late to start being physically active. For older adults, regular physical
activity supports a number of additional health benefits including improved cognition,
balance, and bone strength. These benefits make it easier to perform activities of daily living,
preserves function and mobility, and lowers the risk of falls and injuries from falls.
Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better
than none. To attain the most health benefits from physical activity, older adults need at least
150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The talk test is a good way
to assess moderate intensity for older adults. A person doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity can talk, but not
sing. Older adults also need muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days each week. Older adults should incorporate
multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the related
Move Your Way® resources have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get started. Available

Appendix 2:
Estimated Calorie Needs
The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the person’s age, sex, height, weight,
and level of physical activity. In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many
calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age
and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1 for toddlers ages 12 through
23 months and Table A2-2 for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements
(EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For
toddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet
10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.
Estimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young
children ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated
for older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females.
Adult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per
day for males. As shown, males generally require more calories than females. Due to reductions in basal metabolic
rate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.
Estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy
needs. Additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in Table
A2-3 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories. It is recommended that women follow their
healthcare provider’s guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors, including
prepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain, and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs. Women
with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which may affect
calorie needs.
These calorie needs are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined
with online tools. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can
be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.

a These estimates apply to women with a healthy prepregnancy weight. Women with a prepregnancy weight that is considered overweight or
obese should consult their healthcare provider for guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy and lactation.
b The EER for the first 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 500 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for
milk production during this time period, then subtracting 170 calories/day to account for weight loss in the first 6 months postpartum.
c The EER for the second 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 400 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed
for milk production during this time period. Weight stability is assumed after 6 months postpartum.

Appendix 3:
USDA Dietary Patterns
The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-1 and A3-2) is based on the types and proportions of foods
Americans typically consume but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary
Pattern (Tables A3-3 and A3-4) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern (Table A3-5) are variations
that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary
Patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant
formula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while
staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
The methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food
guides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of
foods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each
food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense
forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the
most appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed
information about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the
Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.1
Amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and Dietary Guidelines
standards (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups). Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population,
and Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The
Patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and
choline for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all
age/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public
health concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1.
The Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For
toddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns
are provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels
for each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each
group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so
that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.

c Food group amounts shown in cup equivalents (cup eq) or ounce equivalents (ounce eq). Oils are shown in grams. Quantity equivalents for each
food group are:
Vegetables, Fruits (1 cup eq): 1 cup raw or cooked vegetable or fruit; 1 cup vegetable or fruit juice; 2 cups leafy salad greens; ½ cup dried fruit
or vegetable.
Grains (1 ounce eq): ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or cereal; 1 ounce dry pasta or rice; 1 medium (1 ounce) slice bread, tortilla, or flatbread; 1 ounce of
ready-to-eat cereal (about 1 cup of flaked cereal).
Dairy (1 cup eq): 1 cup milk, yogurt, or fortified soymilk; 1½ ounces natural cheese such as cheddar cheese or 2 ounces of processed cheese.
Protein Foods (1 ounce eq): 1 ounce lean meats, poultry, or seafood; 1 egg; ¼ cup cooked beans or tofu; 1 tbsp nut or seed butter;
½ ounce nuts or seeds.
d Amounts of whole grains in the Patterns for children are less than the minimum of 3 ounce-eq in all Patterns recommended for adults.
e The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding seafood
consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or are pregnant or breastfeeding, and children. Depending on body
weight, some women and many children should choose seafood lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy
US-Style Eating Pattern. For more information, see the FDA and EPA websites FDA.gov/fishadvice; EPA.gov/fishadvice.
f If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the FDA/EPA joint
“Advice About Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children
should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia,
shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic
mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they
cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be
consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and
EPA.gov/fishadvice.
g Foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms, lean or low-fat and prepared with minimal added saturated fat, added sugars, refined
starches, or salt. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within
the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The amount of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the
amounts of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, added

a Calorie level ranges: Energy levels are calculated based on median length and body weight reference individuals. Calorie needs vary based on
many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/ can be used to estimate calorie
needs based on age, sex, and weight.
b Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup or ounce) equivalents are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in
Table A3-2 (footnote c).
c All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches (which are a source of calories
but few or no other nutrients), or sodium. Food are also lean or in low-fat forms with the exception of dairy which includes whole-fat fluid milk,
reduced-fat plain yogurts, and reduced-fat cheese. There are no calories available for additional added sugars, saturated fat, or to eat more than
the recommended amount of food in a food group.
d In some cases, food subgroup amounts are greatest at the lower calorie levels to help achieve nutrient adequacy when relatively small number
of calories are required.
