      "content": "Several different recommendations for protein intake are mentioned in the provided text:\n\n* **0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight:** This is mentioned as the recommended daily intake for adults and is also referred to as the RDA (recommended dietary allowance).\n* **10-35% of total calorie intake:** This is the AMDR (Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range) for protein.\n* **0.36 grams per pound of body weight:** This is another way to calculate the DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) for protein, equivalent to the 0.8 grams per kilogram recommendation.\n* **10-15% of daily calorie intake:** The Institute of Medicine recommends this amount of daily calories come from protein.\n* **46 grams daily for women and 56 grams daily for men:** These are specific daily recommendations but the context doesn't specify if these are average recommendations or for specific groups.\n\nIt's important to note that some groups, such as children, pregnant or lactating women, and athletes, may require higher protein intake than the general adult recommendation of 0.8 grams per kilogram.  There is also an upper limit of 30% of total calorie intake for protein consumption.\n\nThe text presents multiple potentially conflicting recommendations.  It is best to consult a doctor or registered dietitian to determine the optimal protein intake for your individual needs.\n"
