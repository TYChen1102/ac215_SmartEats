      "content": "Carbohydrate intake recommendations depend on individual factors such as activity level and weight goals.\n\nFor general intake, carbohydrates should comprise 45% to 65% of total daily calories.  More active individuals can aim for the higher end of this range (65%), while those less active or seeking weight loss should aim for the lower end (45%).  To calculate the gram amount, determine 45% to 65% of your daily calorie needs, then divide that number by four.\n\nOne example provided for a 2000 calorie diet suggests 310 grams of carbohydrates per day, compared to 70 grams of fat and 50 grams of protein.  This example seems to represent a higher carbohydrate intake, potentially suitable for a very active individual.  Individuals reducing calorie intake for weight loss should aim for approximately half their daily calories from carbohydrates.\n\nRegarding carbohydrate types, three-quarters of carbohydrate intake should come from complex carbohydrates, while the remaining quarter can be simple carbohydrates.  However, sugar intake should not exceed 10% of total energy intake.\n"

For children one year and older, protein should contribute no more than 12% of their total energy intake.  It's also recommended that 70% of the protein consumed by children come from animal sources.\n"

Following these guidelines can contribute to a healthier lifestyle.\n"
