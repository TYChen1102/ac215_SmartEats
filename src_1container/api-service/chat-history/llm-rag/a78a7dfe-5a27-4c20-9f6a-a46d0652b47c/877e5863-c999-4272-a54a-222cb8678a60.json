      "content": "The recommended daily protein intake for adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound).  However, needs vary.  Children, pregnant or lactating women, and athletes may require more protein.  The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein in adults is 10-35% of total daily calories.  There is also an upper limit of 30% of total calorie intake for protein.\n\nWhile the body needs protein, it doesn't store it like fats and carbohydrates.  Therefore, both protein deficiency and excessive protein intake can negatively impact health.\n"

      "content": "Based on the provided information, a breakfast of Greek yogurt and oatmeal can fit within a healthy eating plan.  The example \"Banana-Walnut Overnight Oats\" provides a 350-calorie breakfast option containing oats, low-fat plain Greek yogurt, fat-free milk, banana, walnuts, and honey.  You can adjust ingredients and portion sizes to meet your specific calorie and nutrient needs.  The text also mentions the importance of choosing whole grains and varying protein and veggie choices throughout your daily meals.  However, consuming *only* Greek yogurt and oatmeal for breakfast, and nothing else all day, isn't explicitly addressed in this text.  A balanced diet with a variety of foods is generally recommended for optimal health.\n"
