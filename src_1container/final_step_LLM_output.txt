Based on the provided information, your pizza meal contains 874.3 kcal, 117.6g carbohydrates, 25g protein, and 32.5g fat.  This meal appears to be high in carbohydrates and fat.

This meal has a moderate risk for hypertension (0.1309) and a low risk for obesity (0.0603), diabetes (0.0291), and high cholesterol (0.0146).  

I can offer some general dietary advice based on recommended intake ranges, but I need more context about your overall diet and health goals to provide personalized recommendations.  The provided references mention acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDR) and dietary guidelines, including recommendations for added sugar, total lipid, and saturated fatty acid intake.  However, without knowing your age, sex, activity level, and other dietary habits, I cannot determine if your pizza meal fits within a healthy dietary pattern.  For example, the AMDR for carbohydrates is 45-65% of total kcal, but I cannot calculate the percentage from this meal alone.  Similarly, information on fiber and added sugar content in the pizza would be needed to assess its nutritional value further.
