Based on the provided information, your pizza meal contains 874.3 kcal, 117.6g carbohydrates, 25g protein, and 32.5g fat.  This meal carries a potential risk for Obesity (0.0603), Diabetes (0.0291), High Cholesterol (0.0146), and Hypertension (0.1309).

While I can see the macronutrient breakdown of your pizza, I need more context to provide specific dietary advice.  I am missing information about your overall daily caloric needs, your current health status, and your dietary goals.  

For example, the provided references mention Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for carbohydrates, fiber, added sugars, and fats.  To assess how this meal fits into a healthy diet, I would need to know these ranges for your specific demographic (age, sex, activity level).  I also need to know your typical daily intake of these nutrients to determine if this meal contributes to exceeding or falling short of recommendations.  

The information about disease risk is helpful, but without knowing your current health status, it's difficult to give personalized advice.  For example, if you already have high cholesterol, I would need to provide more specific recommendations about saturated fat intake than if you did not.

Please provide additional information so I can give you more tailored and helpful dietary advice.
