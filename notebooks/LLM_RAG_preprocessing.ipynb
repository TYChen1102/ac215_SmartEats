      "The Guidelines\n",
      "Make every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans�\n",
      "Here’s how:\n",
      "1\n",
      "Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage�\n",
      "At every life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and\n",
      "older adulthood—it is never too early or too late to eat healthfully.\n",
      "• For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human milk. Continue to feed infants\n",
      "human milk through at least the first year of life, and longer if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant\n",
      "formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable. Provide infants with supplemental\n",
      "vitamin D beginning soon after birth.\n",
      "• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense complementary foods. Introduce infants to\n",
      "potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods. Encourage infants and toddlers\n",
      "to consume a variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich in iron and zinc, particularly for\n",
      "infants fed human milk.\n",
      "• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet\n",
      "nutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect\n",
      "personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations�\n",
      "A healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, or current health\n",
      "status. The Dietary Guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and\n",
      "preferences, as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the United States.\n",
      "3\n",
      "Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages,\n",
      "and stay within calorie limits�\n",
      "An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from\n",
      "foods and beverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide\n",
      "vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added sugars, saturated\n",
      "fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across\n",
      "all food groups, in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.\n",
      "The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:\n",
      "• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and\n",
      "other vegetables\n",
      "• Fruits, especially whole fruit\n",
      "• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain\n",
      "• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified\n",
      "soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives\n",
      "• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts,\n",
      "seeds, and soy products\n",
      "• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts\n",
      "Page ix | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary\n",
      "4 Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and\n",
      "limit alcoholic beverages�\n",
      "At every life stage, meeting food group recommendations—even with nutrient-dense choices—requires most\n",
      "of a person’s daily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy dietary pattern doesn’t have much room for\n",
      "extra added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic beverages. A small amount of added sugars,\n",
      "saturated fat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and beverages to help meet food group\n",
      "recommendations, but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited. Limits are:\n",
      "• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with\n",
      "added sugars for those younger than age 2.\n",
      "• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2.\n",
      "• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and even less for children younger than age 14.\n",
      "• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink, or to drink in moderation by\n",
      "limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is\n",
      "consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink\n",
      "alcohol, such as women who are pregnant.\n",
      "For most individuals, no matter their age or health status,\n",

      "Our bodies contain similar nutrients to the food we eat. Therefore, depending on what kind of food we are consuming and the contents of that food, we are affecting our nutrient levels and over all, our health. On average, the human body is 6% minerals, carbohydrates, and other nutrients, 16% fat, 16% protein, and 62% water. Of course these percentages vary for every individual person depending on diet and lifestyle. Our bodies contain similar nutrients to the food we eat. Therefore, depending on what kind of food we are consuming and the contents of that food, we are affecting our nutrient levels and over all, our health. As mentioned above, it is important to eat a wide variety of foods from the five food groups to ensure that you are consuming all the different nutrients that your body needs. Eating one type of food may supply you with excess of a particular nutrient, but your body will be lacking other vital nutrients only obtainable from different foods. The saying, \"You are what You Eat,\" isn't literally true because if you eat a hamburger, that doesn't make you a cow, however, your nutrient levels will equilibrate with that of the hamburger, or cow, that you are eating. Therefore, always make sure that you are putting healthy foods in your body because it doesn't just come in one end and go out the other. The foods you eat alter the nutrients in your body, making it very important to eat foods that will have a positive and beneficial impact on your body and your health. Almost everything is ok, in proportion. If you eat some ice cream or some candy every once in a while, it will not have a significantly detrimental impact on your health. However, if you eat large quantities of high-sugar foods, such as candy, you can continuously tax your system and eventually cause problems that can effect your health forever, such as Type 2 Diabetes.\n",

      "It is important to make a habit of healthy eating. The more often you eat healthy, the easier it will be and the more you will start to enjoy healthy foods over un-healthy foods. It can be difficult sometimes to choose an apple over a candy bar and you don't always have to, but in the long run, your body will thank you for eating healthy. We often don't think about the nutritional content of our food, but do some research and find out what you're really putting in your body when you eat certain foods. Awareness of the contents of our consumption is the first step in moving towards a healthier diet and therefore a healthier body.\n",

      "According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, malnutrition is defined as \"lack of proper nutrition, caused by not having enough to eat, not eating enough of the right things, or being unable to use the food that one does eat\". At first thought, it is easy to think of malnutrition as only not having enough food however as the definition so evidently points out, it also incorporates not eating enough of the right things for your body or if your body is unable to use the food you are ingesting for what it needs.\n",

      "There are a number of causes of malnutrition. It may result from an inadequate or unbalanced diet, problems with digestion or absorption, certain medical conditions.  Malnutrition can occur if you do not eat enough food. Starvation is a form of malnutrition. You may develop malnutrition if you lack of a single vitamin in the diet.  In some cases, malnutrition is very mild and causes no symptoms. However, sometimes it can be so severe that the damage done to the body is permanent, even though you survive.  Malnutrition continues to be a significant problem all over the world, especially among children. Poverty, natural disasters, political problems, and war all contribute to conditions—even epidemics—of malnutrition and starvation. A study conducted by Action Against Hunger-USA (ACF-USA) among children under five in the Nuer community of Old Fangak, central Upper Nile, found that most of the malnourished children had been sick over an extended period, suffering from diarrhea, respiratory infections and fever, or a combination of several illnesses. Disease and inadequate food intake seemed to have particularly affected children under five years old, the report stated.\n",
